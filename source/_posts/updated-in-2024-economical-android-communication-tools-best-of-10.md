You can video chat for free with all app’s users even if they are accessing WeChat from a computer or iPhone. Moreover, you can organize group calls with up to nine people or send photos, videos, or voice messages instantly to all your contacts.

The app makes it easy to share your location with your contacts, as you just have to tap a button to send exact coordinates to a friend.

### Facetime for Android Alternatives FAQs

#### Can an Android Chat with an iPhone?

Yes, of course, although you can’t use FaceTime, because the app is not compatible with the Android operating system. Installing any of the apps we featured in this article will enable you to communicate with iPhone owners for free, although they will also have the app through which you want to reach them installed on their smartphones. Some video chats also offer the option to call landlines and mobile phones, but this option is not free, and you must find out the rates for the destinations you want to call.

**Conclusion**

Finding the alternative to FaceTime won’t take too long, as there are so many different video chat apps you can use to organize conference calls or group chats. Skype, Facebook Messenger, or Google Duo are some of the most obvious choices, even though millions of people are using apps like WhatsApp, Viber, or WeChat to video chat with their friends and family. Which of the ten best free alternatives to FaceTime on Android do you like the most? Leave a comment below and share your opinions with us.
