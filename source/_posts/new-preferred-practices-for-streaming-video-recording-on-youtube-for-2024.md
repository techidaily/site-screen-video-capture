## Preferred Practices for Streaming Video Recording on YouTube

Live streaming video on YouTube is extremely popular among YouTubers. Live stream videos have a different feel as the video creators can interact with their audiences in real-time. YouTubers use live streaming feature to stream any live event, take live classes, organize live webinars, and much more. If you want to view the live streaming session of your favorite YouTuber at any future instance, you need to record YouTube live stream.

In fact, if you are a YouTuber yourself and you are live streaming, you need a YouTube live stream recorder so that you can record your live stream and upload the video on YouTube. YouTube does come with an option to archive your live streams but it is not reliable. Hence, almost all YouTubers opt for an external live stream screen recorder to record their live sessions. Here is the list of the best YouTube live stream screen recorder apps.
