## 1\. Taking Screenshots on a Chromebook with a Keyboard

Similar to the typical CTRL + PrtScn or PrtScn shortcut used on most Window‚Äôs PCs, or the Command + Control + Shift + 3 shortcut used on Mac devices, taking screenshots with the use of a keyboard on a Chromebook is equally as straight forward. To capture a screenshot of the entire screen, the process requires the use of the **Windows Switcher Key** (look for 3 layered rectangles that resemble open tabs/windows) ‚Äì this is generally located above the number 6 and 7 keys and close to the screen-brightness toggles.

![ Chromebook Screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-keyboard-screenshot.jpg)

The command ‚Äú**Ctrl + \*Windows Switcher Key\***‚Äù will capture a screenshot of your current page, and the command ‚Äú**Ctrl + Shift + \*Windows Switcher Key\***‚Äù will allow users to capture a partial screenshot with the help from a handy drag-selector tool.

**Note**: If your keyboard doesn‚Äôt seem to have the Screen Switcher key, **try using F5 instead**. To ensure your screenshot is copied into a specific document, select ‚Äú**Copy to Clipboard**‚Äù. From here, you‚Äôll be able to paste directly into a document.

## 2\. Taking a Screenshot on a Chromebook with the Use of Side Buttons

Using your Chromebook in tablet mode? If so, then there‚Äôs also a handy way to make use of the screenshot feature whilst on the go. Similar to the function offered on most Smart Phone Devices, simply press both the **Power and Volume Down Side Button** to capture a screenshot. Unfortunately, this feature is only useful if you‚Äôre looking to capture your entire screen; you‚Äôll need to utilize the keyboard or stylus if you‚Äôre planning to crop out a specific section.

**Note:** No matter whether you‚Äôre utilizing the Chromebook in either landscape or portrait mode, the Volume Rockers still remain in the same orientation, so it‚Äôs worth noting which button relates to ‚ÄúVolume Down‚Äù.

What‚Äôs more, if you alter the size of your browser window you can preemptively crop your screenshots before they‚Äôve even been captured.

Once you open up your captured screenshot, you should notice there are a number of icons and actions readily available. These included **editing** (pencil), the ability to **print** (printer icon), to **delete** the item (trashcan), to view it as a **thumbnail** (collage icon), and also a **slideshow** option (triangle within a square). With options such as **Auto-Fixing**, **Cropping**, **Brightness Adjustment**, and even the ability to **Rotate** your saved file, users are able to simply edit their captures at a click of a button. Great for those just looking to touch up or re-jig their saved image, there are plenty of extensions available from the **Web Store** that offer a few more alternatives (**See 4**.).

## 1\. Taking Screenshots on a Chromebook with a Keyboard

Similar to the typical CTRL + PrtScn or PrtScn shortcut used on most Window‚Äôs PCs, or the Command + Control + Shift + 3 shortcut used on Mac devices, taking screenshots with the use of a keyboard on a Chromebook is equally as straight forward. To capture a screenshot of the entire screen, the process requires the use of the **Windows Switcher Key** (look for 3 layered rectangles that resemble open tabs/windows) ‚Äì this is generally located above the number 6 and 7 keys and close to the screen-brightness toggles.

The command ‚Äú**Ctrl + \*Windows Switcher Key\***‚Äù will capture a screenshot of your current page, and the command ‚Äú**Ctrl + Shift + \*Windows Switcher Key\***‚Äù will allow users to capture a partial screenshot with the help from a handy drag-selector tool.

**Note**: If your keyboard doesn‚Äôt seem to have the Screen Switcher key, **try using F5 instead**. To ensure your screenshot is copied into a specific document, select ‚Äú**Copy to Clipboard**‚Äù. From here, you‚Äôll be able to paste directly into a document.
