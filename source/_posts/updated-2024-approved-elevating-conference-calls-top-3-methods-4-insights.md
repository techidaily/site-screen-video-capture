## Part 3\. Record Hangout Sessions on Phone

If you are using Google Hangouts from your phone and you want to record hangouts call and meeting sessions, we have different methods for iPhone and Android.

**For iPhone:**

If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you do not have to install any external app. This is because iOS 11 comes with an inbuilt screen recording feature. You can get access to this screen recorder from Control Center. If it is not readily available, you have to activate the feature and start recording the screen which is Hangouts calls and meetings here. Here are the steps you have to follow.

It is a completely free app and there is no watermark issue. Here are the steps to follow to record Google Hangout with Mobizen screen recorder.
