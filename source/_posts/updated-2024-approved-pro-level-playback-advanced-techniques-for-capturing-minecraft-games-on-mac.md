What makes it more interesting is that it is not only a media player but can also perform screen recording in real-time. The application has a very minimalist user interface and it offers screen recording in different settings. You can record Minecraft with QuickTime Player on your Mac device by following these steps:

![quicktime screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-new-movie-recording.jpg)

* First, check whether your device has a pre-installed QuickTime installed in it. Generally, you can search the QuickTime application in the search bar of your Mac, and if it's available then click on the icon. If it's not, then visit Apple's official website and you will find the download page for the QuickTime player from there. Then download it and install it on your device.
* After opening QuickTime player on any Mac, the user will be available with a bunch of tools and options such as "Files", "view", "edit" tabs, etc. From there you will need to select the "Files" option and click on it. When you open this, a dropdown menu will appear on your screen which will have several items shown in it.
* From the dropdown menu select "New Movie Recording" and the application will start the screen recording with a timer of 3 seconds. Now go to Minecraft and play the game as per your wish. Then when you are done with recording Minecraft, click on the stop button available as an overlay on your screen and the game will be saved to your device.

If it's not present then you can add a scene by clicking on the plus sign right next to the "Scenes" option. This option should be present on the left corner of your screen.
* Then, scroll down to the option that says "Sources". The sources option will be generally on the bottom panel of the interface you are using.
