## Conclusion

Today, we live in a world where screen recorders have immense importance and Screencastify is one of the most promising applications available out there. It is fast, reliable as well as available on all the OS. And this web-based application works amazingly on the Chrome web browser which makes it popular. In case you are not using the Chrome browser, then you can also use alternative screen recorders that can be used in any other browser that has been explained in this article.

2\. How to Use Screencastify?

To put Screencastify to use, you need to opt for the given step-wise process:

* At first, opt for clicking the "Add to Chrome" option at its official website so you are able to add Chrome extension without any trouble.

* Now, by signing into your account, you may go for the editor page where you can go for the addition of video files. You can then get started with the editing process right away. You can trim your videos, add clips or delete them or rearrange them as you please.

## 4\. Best Screencastify Alternatives
