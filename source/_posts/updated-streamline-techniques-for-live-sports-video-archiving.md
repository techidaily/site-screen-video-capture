****Step 3:** As soon as you’re in game, to manually report a casino game clip, at the same time press the windows key + Gary the gadget guy to call upward the Game Club or click on the Xbox key on a control. Once the Video game Bar appears, strike the record button, and you’re good to go. A person can also strike the “Record that” button left of the record button to grab the last 30 secs when background documenting is active.

For a great video walkthrough of the process outlined in this post.
