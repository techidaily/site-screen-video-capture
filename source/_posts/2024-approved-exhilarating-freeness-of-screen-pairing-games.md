Here is another cool and feature-rich webcam-based basketball game that can be accessed directly from browser and Mac systems as well. Players can control ball motion by moving their hands in front of the camera. Although the graphics quality of this game is above average, most players rate it lower due to messy motion detection and ball physics abilities.

This game can be played in two different modes; you can either switch to the multiplayer mode or the arcade mode. You need to collect maximum points by directing your shots very carefully and target your basket perfectly to move to the next level.

The gaming world has undergone lots of advancements; today the latest console games provide a realistic gaming experience with interactive features. Players simply act in front of the console camera and the advanced sensor units detect their body movements to synchronize game characters accordingly. Indeed, the thought is quite awesome, but the sad truth is that not everyone can invest in expensive consoles. However, it doesn’t mean that you cannot enjoy these interactive games. If you are a crazy gamer, we can help you to get some PC alternatives of latest games, and they can be a part of your gaming routines for free. You can launch these games instantly on your PC and get started with the body movements to have real fun.

## Best Free Webcam Games for PC and Laptop

#### 1. WebCam Mania

![Webcam Games ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-webcam-pc-games-play-online-webcam-mania.jpg)

Here is a top-rated collection of various short duration flash games that work online and support webcam-based operations. In order to make your characters do something on the screen, you need to move your limbs, especially arms in a specific direction with exact motion so that desired job can be done. In one part of this game, players need to block the snowballs to defend his snow castle, and it can be done by moving hands in both directions. One more addition to this series is more interesting where the player needs to pop the green bubbles available on the screen while saving the red ones.

You will love the graphics, background music and animations of this game. But note that its ability to sense your limb movements completely depends on the webcam quality. The great news for crazy gamers is that it is a two-player game where his player can have his personal paddle on one portion of the screen.

But you will love the way it adds few unique games in between and allow players to do experiments with advanced photo editing effects and filters. It plays 11 different games in series, and you can control them by simply moving your limbs including head, legs, and arms.

People love the way developers have merged 3D modeling with this gaming platform while supporting awesome display features.
