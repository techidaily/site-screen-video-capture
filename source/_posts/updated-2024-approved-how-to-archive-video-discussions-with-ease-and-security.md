## FAQs About Microsoft Teams Meeting Recording

**Q1) Can I record a meeting in Microsoft Teams on mobile?**

**A1)** Yes. As long as you are using the correct license that comes along with the recording feature, you can record Microsoft Teams meetings on both Android and iOS devices. The licenses that allow recording are Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Essentials, or Business Premium.

**Q2) Who can start or stop a recording of a Teams meeting?**

**A2)** The organizer of the meeting or a person from the same organization can start or stop the recording.

**Q3) Will people know if I start a recording on Teams meeting?**

**A3)** Yes. If you are using the Teams’ built-in recording feature to record a meeting, all the attendees will be notified about it. If you don’t want anyone to know that you are recording a session, you can use an efficient third-party app like Wondershare Filmora, and follow the steps explained earlier to learn **how to record Teams meeting** behind the scenes.
