If you are looking for a powerful screen recorder that offers easy-to-use screencasting tools, then this software is the right choice for you.

You can easily create GIFs that can be used in PowerPoint presentations, posted on blogs and websites, or sent via email.

GIF Screen Recorder lets you customize the region of the screen you'd like to capture, and it enables you to select the length of the preferred frame rate of the recording.

Starting a new screencast requires you to designate the screen area by dragging a corner of a large red rectangle that appears on the screen when you launch the GIF Screen Recorder and hit the Record button.

The software also features the editing mode to add subtitles to your animated GIFs or export image frames.

#### 3. [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)

**Price:** Free

Click on the Record button to capture the animated GIF file and save it on your hard drive. LICEcap enables you to save your GIFs in LCF and GIF file formats, but its file-sharing capabilities are next to non-existent.

**Price:** Free, Paid version: $37

**Compatibility:** Windows XP, 2003, Vista and 7

![fraps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps-movies-settings.jpg)

Fraps is probably one of the oldest screen recorders for gaming because it was released 18 years ago, and besides providing video capture features, it can also be used for benchmarking or displaying frame rates.

Fraps don't offer support for GIF files, which means that you can only use it to create an MP.4 or AVI file that you can later convert to GIF file format. Capturing videos and still frames outside of a video game is not on the list of options the software offers.

#### 6. [ShareX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
