Screencasting on any version of Windows 7/8/10 is a simple task, and countless software products enable you to record your desktop activities.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

On the other hand, GIFs are small in size, and sending them via email or posting them on social media networks won't require you to wait for a long time until the file is uploaded to the web.

However, there aren't that many screen recorders for Windows OS that let you save screen recordings as GIF files, and for that reason, we've composed the list of best **GIF Recorders** for PCs. Let's have a look at some of the most powerful software products for creating animated GIFs on Windows.

**Price:** $ 29,95

**Compatibility:** Windows XP (SP3) or later

![GIF Screen Recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gif-screen-recorder.jpg)

If you are looking for a powerful screen recorder that offers easy-to-use screencasting tools, then this software is the right choice for you.

You can easily create GIFs that can be used in PowerPoint presentations, posted on blogs and websites, or sent via email.

GIF Screen Recorder lets you customize the region of the screen you'd like to capture, and it enables you to select the length of the preferred frame rate of the recording.

Starting a new screencast requires you to designate the screen area by dragging a corner of a large red rectangle that appears on the screen when you launch the GIF Screen Recorder and hit the Record button.

The software also features the editing mode to add subtitles to your animated GIFs or export image frames.

#### 3. [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)

The software's main window is transparent, and it allows you to see a portion of the background beneath it. The LICEcap screen recorder will capture the amount of the screen over which it is located, so you'll have to place it on the part of the desktop you want to record.

Click on the Record button to capture the animated GIF file and save it on your hard drive. LICEcap enables you to save your GIFs in LCF and GIF file formats, but its file-sharing capabilities are next to non-existent.

![ScreenToGif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screentogif.jpg)

Screencasting on any version of Windows 7/8/10 is a simple task, and countless software products enable you to record your desktop activities.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

On the other hand, GIFs are small in size, and sending them via email or posting them on social media networks won't require you to wait for a long time until the file is uploaded to the web.

However, there aren't that many screen recorders for Windows OS that let you save screen recordings as GIF files, and for that reason, we've composed the list of best **GIF Recorders** for PCs. Let's have a look at some of the most powerful software products for creating animated GIFs on Windows.
