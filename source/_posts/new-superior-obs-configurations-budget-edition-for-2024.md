## Superior OBS Configurations - Budget Edition

In the past two decades, the digital and IT industry is growing at a jet pace. Programmers are inventing more applications to make our life easier. Similarly, the invention of youtube is one of its prevalent examples of all inventions. Billions of people are watching youtube, among them, millions are video streamers.

We recommend you the best studio software known as OBS for your streaming using the best OBS settings for your low-end PC or a Laptop. These OBS settings will let you record videos for low-end PC or laptops to stream now without any issues. Keeping things in a little hurry let's straight dive into the real stuff of this article.

## 1\. Video Settings

Since we are concerned about the streaming of video. It is important to know how to set up your videos settings. To set your video settings you need to follow the steps given below.

### Step 1: Go to Settings

First, you will need to launch your OBS software. On the main menu, you have to go to file-> settings. You will see a new window will pop up for settings as shown in the figure below.

### Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep

Starting with base resolution, it is the video resolution that we are going to send to the people who are going to watch our stream. So for the best one, click on it and choose **1280\*720**.

Output tab, which is the resolution of the video that the people will watch. For fast and lag-free streaming it's best to keep both the output and base resolution the same to avoid any conversion between the resolution by CPU. So click on output resolution and choose **1280\*720** again. If you noticed your computer is still lagging then it's best to change to 480p but below this, it's not recommended.

![obs settings that you should keep](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-settings-that-you-should-keep.jpg)

After that, it comes to the filter option. There are multiple filter options in this tab but for a fast and better result, you have to choose the **“bilinear”** filter as shown in the figure below. Finally, when it comes to frame per second you gotta be careful here. The more the fps the more it will put load on your CPU means it will become laggy but it is best to keep it **30 fps**, not more than this and not less than this if you are using a low-end PC or Laptop.

### Step 3: Output Settings

Once you are done with the general video settings now it's time you should come to the output settings. For that, you will need to choose the output from the main vertical tab as shown in the figure below in 1\. You will see a new window appears with a variety of settings. Now it's time to choose the advanced setting as shown in 2 in the figure to see all settings to be edited.

![obs output settings edited](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-settings-edited.jpg)

Let's move towards the detail settings for the output video for your audience it's best to choose the settings shown in the figure and below for lag-free and jitter-free video.

**Encoder:**

The first setting is the encoder setting for your output video. There are two options for it, if you are not using any NVidia graphics card and relying on CPU then it is best to choose x264, which will utilize your CPU.

**Rescale Output:**

The rescale output settings should be kept the same as 720p of the video you are streaming.

**Rate Control:**

Keep the rate control CBR.

**Bitrate:**

Normally, for low-end PCs, you should keep the bitrate to 3000 kbps. However, if you are finding it struggling with your PC in the form of a lag or jitteriness then it's recommended to drop it low till you get the better results. For the NVIDIA card keep the bitrate to 3000 as it is perfectly fine for it.

**CPU Usage Preset:**

It comes with a lot of options to keep your CPU usage for the video. It is best recommended to keep the CPU usage very fast for good results. If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card then it is best to change the CPU usage to "performance” to get the best out of your machine.

**Profile:**

By default, the profile option is disabled and you should keep these settings as it is if you are not using the NVIDIA card but if it's not so then it's recommended to choose the “main” on the profiling option.

So that’s it for the video settings. These are all the settings that you need to adjust before streaming. After doing it so you just need to click apply button below and bingo it is done.

## 2\. Audio Settings

For a clear and better audio performance, it's also necessary you keep the optimum settings for the audio too. Well, you don’t have to worry now about the audio too. After reading this article you should keep the same audio settings here for your PC or Laptop.

The audio settings can be adjusted from two places. Let us discuss the first one. For that, you will need to select the output in the vertical tab and go to audio as shown in the figure below. You will see multiple tracks in these windows. It contains the audio settings for multiple sources. However, if you are using a single it's good to choose 320 in track one. For multiple, there is no need to change the audio track but to keep the same 320\. These are the perfect settings for most cases of the audio settings for your computer.

### Step 2: Audio Tab Settings

![obs audio tab settings steps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-audio-tab-settings-steps.jpg)

The audio consists of many settings,it is divided into categories lets start one by one and explain it.

**Sample Rate and Channels:**

It is the resolution of the audio. The more the sampling rate the more the bits of the audio you sent which means the more the quality of the audio improves. However, there is no need to keep it high but an optimum value works well too. Therefore, keep it **48khz** for the best result as shown. Another thing is a channel, which contains a lot of options but most of you will want the **“stereo”** since it’s the most common choice from the streamers.

**Desktop Audios:**

The desktop audio depends on the device you are using for the audio. It is best to use the default if you don’t know about your device otherwise choose USB if you are audio uses the USB port. For the second audio source, you can choose desktop audio 2 and set it accordingly.

**Auxiliary Audio:**

The streamers usually have one mic source but if you have multiple mic sources then you choose up to 4 auxiliary audio ports and set the device's settings.

**Meter: Decay Rate & Peak Meter Type:**

The meter is a decibel meter (dB). It is a measurement of volume. The more the decibels, the more it is loud. So use the decay rate to choose between fast, medium, and slow volumes accordingly to your needs. The Peak Meter type is used for your CPU usage. IF you have set higher CPU usage then go for the “true peak” otherwise chose “sample peak”.

Finally, the rest of the options should be kept as default since being a streamer you won’t need them to change and they are pretty much basic hotkeys to set up if you wish to.

## 3\. Stream Settings

Here are the streaming settings that you just need to follow for your streaming videos. The streaming tab consists of settings for the platform you are going to stream your video. Let's begin with step-by-step procedures to follow for the best streaming settings for your low-end PCs or laptops.
