You can also add plants and flowers around your base to make it look outstanding. The tutorial will help you with each and every step of building this base. Follow each step the way it is described for preferred and required results. The best thing about this underground house is it doesn't allow mold to grow on the walls of your house, unlike a real-life basement, thanks to Minecraft developers.
