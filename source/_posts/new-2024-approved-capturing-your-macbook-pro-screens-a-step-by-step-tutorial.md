## Conclusion

There may be other tools and screen recorders in the market available for your MacBook Air. But for the sake of carrying important information to all the users out there looking for information regarding screen recorders then we serve our purpose for them. Here in this article, the aim was to provide the simplest application and ways to record your screen with great ease. We started with pretty much basic screen recording shortcuts and basic applications to screen record your Mac. We greatly hope after reading this article it will be never a problem for you to screen record anytime using your MacBook Air.

Part 2: Use QuickTime Player

Another hidden application in your MacBook Air utility program that already comes built-in with Mac OS is QuickTime Player. With this player, you can easily record your screen and take screenshots along the system audio as well as microphone input. To access this application and utilize it for your purpose all you need is to follow the steps given in the coming section.

First, you will need to look into your applications row on your desktop screen. You will probably see the QuickTime player icon there. Right-click on the icon and start the new screen recorder to access the application. Or you can use the other method to access it with QuickTime open from the upper bar as shown in the figure below.

Once you are done with launching the GUI of the application, it's time to learn how can you start recording now. Before starting your recording with the red icon of the start button as shown it is important to choose whether you want microphone input to be recorded or not. You can easily do it by enabling the internal microphone in the settings as shown in the figure. Once you are done with the settings it's time to start your recording.

Click on the start recording button and you will see a new window will pop up to choose the screen recording mode from it as shown in the figure below. To record in the full-screen recording mode you just need to click randomly on the screen once and it will start recording the whole screen. Otherwise, drag and select a particular area on the screen and click start recording once shown and you will have the recording of the particular screen area.
