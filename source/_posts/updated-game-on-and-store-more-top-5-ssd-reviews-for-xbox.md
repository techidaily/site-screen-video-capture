Wouldn't it be frustrating if you had to delete a game before you wanted to? These days, it's all too common for gamers to have to clear their hard drives when a new game is released.

Games like Call of Duty see the astonishing patch sizes: Warzone lately may mean you can only update a game rather than get a new one, and still, you'll run out of space. It is possible to store hundreds of games using an external hard drive, making them available to you without downloading them again.

You will still need more storage, though an SSD is more efficient and recommended if you buy the Xbox Series S or Series X.

If you're looking for a bit more space, we've created a list of the best Xbox external hard drives.

## **Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024**

#### 1. Seagate 2TB Xbox Game Drive

![seagate-2tb-xbox-game-drive-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seagate-2tb-xbox-game-drive-poster.png)

Depending on whether you want to store media or play games, you can choose between a 2 or 4GB version of this external hard drive on Xbox. With this drive, you get a standard Seagate drive in a flashier case. The (admittedly quite nice) embossed Xbox logo and official green case are an additional $15-20\. It's a great choice if the price is right for you, and aesthetics are a concern. Esthetics are important to me, so I think this is the best choice. As often happens around big retail events, Seagate's 2TB Game Drive in official Xbox green often drops in price, so though this is a great time to buy, we can expect further savings in the coming months.

**Price:**

[Check on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01065S79E/).

**Features:**

* Fast and Reliable
* Vast Storage of 2TB
* Compatible with different versions of Xbox.
* It is a value for money hard drive.

#### 2. WD Black P10 1-5TB Game Drive

![wd-black-p10-1-5tb-game-drive-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wd-black-p10-1-5tb-game-drive-poster.png)

Hard drives like the WD Black P10 are excellent for expanding storage capacity on the go. The metal topside gives it a bit of a shipping container aesthetic even though it's not listed as an armored or "rugged" hard drive. The hard drive remains cool even after extensive usage and runs quietly without making any noise.

Although the drive's write speed is not special at 130 megabytes per second, we found that it matched the console's internal hard drive, So you can run the games directly from the hard drive without worrying about any lags or delays.

The best thing about this hard drive is that you can find it with different storage capacities ranging from 1Tb to 5Tb. So, the users have the option to choose suitable storage options according to their needs.

 **Price:**

[Check On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBlack-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VNTFHD5)

**Features**:

* It is extremely portable
* Always runs quietly and cool
* The 3-year warranty is quite reasonable.
* Price is high but is value for money.

#### 3\. Toshiba 1TB Canvio Advance

![toshiba-1tb-canvio-advance-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toshiba-1tb-canvio-advance-poster.jpg)

We've selected a new budget pick for the best external hard drive for Xbox. With a sleek, glossy design, a simple, elegant design, and a nice blue power-light on top, the Toshiba Canvio Advance is an attractive piece of kit. Works just fine. All the drives on this list match its read and write speeds, and it comes with a two-year warranty. Your Xbox console has a USB port that you can connect to, and proceed as usual...

Additionally, suppose you want to use it for PCs as well. In that case, it includes password protection and automatic backup of files, both of which make it a better budget pick than our previous budget pick, the Canvio Basics. There is only one real disadvantage to the Advance: it does not come in green, so you cannot match it with your console. Nonetheless, white looks slick next to many Xbox consoles. You cannot beat the price of the 1TB version, which is around $50 / £50.

**Price:**

[Check On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Canvio-Advance-Portable-External/dp/B08JKFY8FH/)

**Features:**

* Small and Compact In Size
* Available in multiple colors.
* Extremely affordable.
* Standard speed but matches to that of your console.

#### 4. Seagate Expansion 8TB

![seagate-expansion-8tb-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seagate-expansion-8tb-poster.png)

Seagate's Expansion 8TB drives are USB 3.0 compatible and offer more storage than you'll probably ever need. This is the ideal choice for those who use their Xbox Ones often and don't want to worry about storage in the future. It is more expensive and requires an external power adapter (supplied), but it is a surprising device for its size. Seagate's Expansion 8TB weighs 2.09 lbs and is considerably lighter than large rival capacity external hard drives, including the WD 8TB My Book drive, which weighs 2.9 lbs and measures 1.9 x 5.5 x 6.7 in.

**Price:**

[View on Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B01HAPGEIE?tag=georiot-in-default-21&ascsubtag=grd-row-1888675391884567800-20&geniuslink=true)

**Features:**

* A vast amount of storage space
* Excellent value
* It needs to be plugged into the mains due to its size and capacity
* A bit large but the capacity is great.

#### 5\. OWC Envoy Pro EX SSD

![owc-envoy-pro-ex-ssd-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/owc-envoy-pro-ex-ssd-poster.png)

A neat little SSD with outstanding form and functionality, the OWC Envoy Pro EX SSD is a solid performer. Its high-ish price tag is due to this and the fact that it's an SSD, but the quality you get is undeniable.

In terms of technology, this is a wonderful piece of kit: a sleek, stylish, silver wedge-shaped drive with a single LED and one connection port that is very robust and pocket-sized. Despite being small, it feels solid and can survive bumps and drops as long as it is handled with care. Despite its size, it's impressively stylish - for a hard drive - and can be hidden behind a gaming console.

Using the software on board, you can turn it into a PC external drive without a problem. This is also how we uncovered 411Mbps read speed and 248Mbps write speed using Crystal Disk Mark. There is no doubt that this is a solid and reliable enough Xbox external hard drive.

**Price:**

In terms of technology, this is a wonderful piece of kit: a sleek, stylish, silver wedge-shaped drive with a single LED and one connection port that is very robust and pocket-sized. Despite being small, it feels solid and can survive bumps and drops as long as it is handled with care. Despite its size, it's impressively stylish - for a hard drive - and can be hidden behind a gaming console.

Using the software on board, you can turn it into a PC external drive without a problem. This is also how we uncovered 411Mbps read speed and 248Mbps write speed using Crystal Disk Mark. There is no doubt that this is a solid and reliable enough Xbox external hard drive.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Wouldn't it be frustrating if you had to delete a game before you wanted to? These days, it's all too common for gamers to have to clear their hard drives when a new game is released.

Games like Call of Duty see the astonishing patch sizes: Warzone lately may mean you can only update a game rather than get a new one, and still, you'll run out of space. It is possible to store hundreds of games using an external hard drive, making them available to you without downloading them again.

You will still need more storage, though an SSD is more efficient and recommended if you buy the Xbox Series S or Series X.

If you're looking for a bit more space, we've created a list of the best Xbox external hard drives.

## **Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024**

#### 1. Seagate 2TB Xbox Game Drive

![seagate-2tb-xbox-game-drive-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seagate-2tb-xbox-game-drive-poster.png)

Depending on whether you want to store media or play games, you can choose between a 2 or 4GB version of this external hard drive on Xbox. With this drive, you get a standard Seagate drive in a flashier case. The (admittedly quite nice) embossed Xbox logo and official green case are an additional $15-20\. It's a great choice if the price is right for you, and aesthetics are a concern. Esthetics are important to me, so I think this is the best choice. As often happens around big retail events, Seagate's 2TB Game Drive in official Xbox green often drops in price, so though this is a great time to buy, we can expect further savings in the coming months.

**Price:**

[Check on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01065S79E/).

**Features:**

* Fast and Reliable
* Vast Storage of 2TB
* Compatible with different versions of Xbox.
* It is a value for money hard drive.

#### 2. WD Black P10 1-5TB Game Drive

![wd-black-p10-1-5tb-game-drive-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wd-black-p10-1-5tb-game-drive-poster.png)

Hard drives like the WD Black P10 are excellent for expanding storage capacity on the go. The metal topside gives it a bit of a shipping container aesthetic even though it's not listed as an armored or "rugged" hard drive. The hard drive remains cool even after extensive usage and runs quietly without making any noise.

Although the drive's write speed is not special at 130 megabytes per second, we found that it matched the console's internal hard drive, So you can run the games directly from the hard drive without worrying about any lags or delays.

The best thing about this hard drive is that you can find it with different storage capacities ranging from 1Tb to 5Tb. So, the users have the option to choose suitable storage options according to their needs.

 **Price:**

[Check On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBlack-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VNTFHD5)

**Features**:

* It is extremely portable
* Always runs quietly and cool
* The 3-year warranty is quite reasonable.
* Price is high but is value for money.

#### 3\. Toshiba 1TB Canvio Advance

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![toshiba-1tb-canvio-advance-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toshiba-1tb-canvio-advance-poster.jpg)

We've selected a new budget pick for the best external hard drive for Xbox. With a sleek, glossy design, a simple, elegant design, and a nice blue power-light on top, the Toshiba Canvio Advance is an attractive piece of kit. Works just fine. All the drives on this list match its read and write speeds, and it comes with a two-year warranty. Your Xbox console has a USB port that you can connect to, and proceed as usual...

Additionally, suppose you want to use it for PCs as well. In that case, it includes password protection and automatic backup of files, both of which make it a better budget pick than our previous budget pick, the Canvio Basics. There is only one real disadvantage to the Advance: it does not come in green, so you cannot match it with your console. Nonetheless, white looks slick next to many Xbox consoles. You cannot beat the price of the 1TB version, which is around $50 / £50.

**Price:**

[Check On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Canvio-Advance-Portable-External/dp/B08JKFY8FH/)

**Features:**

* Small and Compact In Size
* Available in multiple colors.
* Extremely affordable.
* Standard speed but matches to that of your console.

#### 4. Seagate Expansion 8TB

![seagate-expansion-8tb-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seagate-expansion-8tb-poster.png)

Seagate's Expansion 8TB drives are USB 3.0 compatible and offer more storage than you'll probably ever need. This is the ideal choice for those who use their Xbox Ones often and don't want to worry about storage in the future. It is more expensive and requires an external power adapter (supplied), but it is a surprising device for its size. Seagate's Expansion 8TB weighs 2.09 lbs and is considerably lighter than large rival capacity external hard drives, including the WD 8TB My Book drive, which weighs 2.9 lbs and measures 1.9 x 5.5 x 6.7 in.

**Price:**

[View on Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B01HAPGEIE?tag=georiot-in-default-21&ascsubtag=grd-row-1888675391884567800-20&geniuslink=true)

**Features:**

* A vast amount of storage space
* Excellent value
* It needs to be plugged into the mains due to its size and capacity
* A bit large but the capacity is great.

#### 5\. OWC Envoy Pro EX SSD
