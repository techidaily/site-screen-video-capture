Features:

* Works with iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch products
* Sleek video conference calling that is super professional
* Apple ID sign in for extra security

Pros:

* Best video call app for iPhone in terms of compatibility with Apple goods and services
* Really professional but doesn’t confine itself to business. Perfectly suitable for family and friend contact

Cons:

* You cannot get Facetime at all if you live in Saudi Arabia, the UAE or Pakistan
* If the person you are calling doesn’t have an iPhone, iPad, or iPod, you won’t be able to use it.

### 10\. [WeChat](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wechat/id414478124)

WeChat is also aimed at the younger generations, but it is more Gen Z and less under-the-age-of-ten.

Features:

* Custom sticker making, a gallery and a time capsule feature from your memories
* Direction sharing for easy meetups, mini-programs, and top stories
