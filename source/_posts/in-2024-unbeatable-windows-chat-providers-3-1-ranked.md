### 2\. [IMO](https://imo.im/)

Another top-notch video calling app for PC is IMO, the instant messaging app. Imo isn’t just a great video call app for PC Windows 10 – but they have compatible versions for Mac, iOS, and Android.

The one that everyone knows by name (and by far the most popular video calling app for PCs) is Skype.
