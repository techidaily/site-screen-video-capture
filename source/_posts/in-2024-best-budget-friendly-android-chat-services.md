With a user base of more than 210 million people, Snapchat is easily one of the best video chat apps for Android and iPhones. Besides giving you the option to video chat with 16 friends at the same time, Snapchat also offers the possibility to send video snaps or photos that disappear just seconds after you sent them to all of your contacts.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it. Doodling over the video while the call is still in progress, applying or creating photo and video filters and discovering where your friends hang out are just a few among countless options Snapchat provides.

WhatsApp lets its users create groups that can have up to 256 members, which makes it easy to communicate with large numbers of people at the same time.

With a user base of more than 210 million people, Snapchat is easily one of the best video chat apps for Android and iPhones.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it. Doodling over the video while the call is still in progress, applying or creating photo and video filters and discovering where your friends hang out are just a few among countless options Snapchat provides.

With 2.4 billion active users, Facebook is the largest social media platform in the world, which makes Facebook Messenger one of the most frequently used messaging apps today. If you have a Facebook account, you already have access to Facebook Messenger, but you don’t have to be a Facebook user in order to use this app.

Facebook Messenger can be installed on any device that supports iOS, macOS, Windows or Android operating systems, and used to send text messages, start video calls or participate in group video chats. The app gains access to all the contacts in your phone and allows you to communicate with them regardless of the device they are using. You can record audio or video messages and send them instantly to each of your contacts.

### 8. Line

The fact that Line has 600 million users hints just how popular this cross-platform messaging app really is. In addition to free voice and video call options, Line also enables its users to participate in group calls with up to 200 people. Besides chatting, sending audio and video messages, stickers, or even GPS coordinates, you can also use Line as a social network.

The social networking features enable you to update your status on a daily basis or comment on posts your friends share on Line. In case you would like to make international calls to landlines and mobile phones you can use the Line Out that lets you connect with your friends regardless of where they are. Even though Line can be used for free, you should keep in mind that the app displays ads and offers in-app purchases.

### Facetime for Android Alternatives FAQs

#### Can an Android Chat with an iPhone?

Yes, of course, although you can’t use FaceTime, because the app is not compatible with the Android operating system. Installing any of the apps we featured in this article will enable you to communicate with iPhone owners for free, although they will also have the app through which you want to reach them installed on their smartphones. Some video chats also offer the option to call landlines and mobile phones, but this option is not free, and you must find out the rates for the destinations you want to call.

**Conclusion**

Finding the alternative to FaceTime won’t take too long, as there are so many different video chat apps you can use to organize conference calls or group chats. Skype, Facebook Messenger, or Google Duo are some of the most obvious choices, even though millions of people are using apps like WhatsApp, Viber, or WeChat to video chat with their friends and family.
