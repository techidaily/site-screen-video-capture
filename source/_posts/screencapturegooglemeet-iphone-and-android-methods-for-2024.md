## Part 1: Before Recording Google Meet on Phone as a Host/Participant?

Google Meet video sessions can be recorded on both iPhone and Android devices. However, you need to fulfill specific requirements before Google Meet allows you to record screen activity. Let's look at all requirements one by one and know **how to record Google meet on phone as a participant** or host.

### 1. Join the Google Meet session

You have to join the meeting room through an invitation link or code. If you are a host, creating your own meeting session is the only option. In short, you must be part of the meeting session to record the Google Meet session on your phone as no one other than the participants can record the session.

### 2. Get permission from the administrator

The recording must be enabled in the Google administrator settings. Otherwise, you won't be able to record on Google Meet.

## Part 2: How to Record Google Meet on Android Phone with in-built Screen Recording Feature?

However, you can record Google Meet on Android phones with their in-built screen recording feature. Here are a few simple steps to record Google Meet on Android phones with screenshots.

#### Step 1: Join the meeting

You have to join the meeting room through an invitation link or code. If you are a host, creating your own meeting session is the only option.

## Part 1: Before Recording Google Meet on Phone as a Host/Participant?

Google Meet video sessions can be recorded on both iPhone and Android devices. However, you need to fulfill specific requirements before Google Meet allows you to record screen activity. Let's look at all requirements one by one and know **how to record Google meet on phone as a participant** or host.

### 1. Join the Google Meet session

You have to join the meeting room through an invitation link or code. If you are a host, creating your own meeting session is the only option. In short, you must be part of the meeting session to record the Google Meet session on your phone as no one other than the participants can record the session.

### 2. Get permission from the administrator

The recording must be enabled in the Google administrator settings. Otherwise, you won't be able to record on Google Meet.

### 3. The external screen recording application

If Google Meet's built-in screen recording feature cannot be enabled because you are not using a **workplace account**, you must record screen activity through an external tool.

### 4. A working microphone, screen panel, and camera

Mainly, the microphone and screen panel are involved in recording Google video sessions. So, they must be operational. Plus, if you also want to record footage from your camera, your smartphone must be working too.
