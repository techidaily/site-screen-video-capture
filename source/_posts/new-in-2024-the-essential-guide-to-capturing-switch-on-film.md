# How to Capture Your Nintendo Switch Game Video

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The Nintendo Switch is one part handheld and one-part home console single device used to play games despite your location. The introduction of a hybrid console is truly a success that offers an extraordinary graphical quality while transitioning within the home console. Although this unique adaptability needs the compromise over functionality and power compared with the handhelds and dedicated consoles that have been introduced before. The games are played on the home part that is dock and console itself, over which we put the console in the dock to get the output image over the TV screen.

Moreover, it doesn’t require the installation of the software over the hard drive. It also includes the Micro SD slot at the switch backside, which provides additional storage capacity. But the main question is **how to record switch gameplay**?

There are basically three ways for **Nintendo switch video capture** gameplay.

This article will be in two part:

---

Part I: Capture Your Switch Video

* [**1\. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button**](#part1)
* [**2\. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function**](#part2)
* [](#part3)[**3\. Record your whole gameplay with Capture Card**](#part3)

---

### 1\. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button

The controllers come up with the built-in capture button. However, this button only allows the screenshot of the video which is not ideal in any case. But it records the video for 30 seconds as well. If this time is enough to capture your gameplay then do the steps:

**Step 1:** Hold the controller in your hand.

**Step 2:** Press the capture button on the left side of controller.

![switch-game-console](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-console-pic.png)

**Step 3:** Hold down this capture button marked with the square

**Step 4:** Wait until the message regarding capture completion is received at the screen top

**Step 5:** Your last 30 seconds of gameplay will be saved in the ‘Albums.’ It will record the 30 seconds gameplay right before you press the button down, so there is no need to worry about hitting it in advance. It is a quite simple step and allows only posting the clips to social media or saving them in your phone album. It also provides video editing before posting it on social media. You will be able to see the Nintendo Switch video capture in the Albums.

 ![switch-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-interface.png)

### 2\. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function

If you wish to save some important moves of your game in your album, then here is the second way. Some games have the option of replay saving at their bottoms, [complete list](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/27540/~/how-to-capture-and-edit-gameplay-video) including:

* _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_
* _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_
* _ARMS_
* _Splatoon 2_

Let’s take Smach Bros as an example. To do the recording, follow the steps:

**Step 1:** As soon as you have finished the game, the screen of the final score appears. A button appears at the top right down corner of the screen ‘Do you want to save the game’. ![smash-bro-ending](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-interface.png)

**Step 2:** Click on the ‘Y’ button and then click on ‘Save.’![smash-bros-saving](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-saving.png)

Tips: Make sure that you don’t press buttons other than ‘Y’ if you want to save the gameplay. The game replay will be lost if you do so.

**Step 3:** The video will be saved in the replays where you can check it. Go to the ‘Menu’ and then ‘Replays’, and the saved video will appear here (however, there is one limitation of such replays saved, that is they will be deleted as soon as the game is updated so make sure that you save the game replays in your album).

To convert the replays in the video, a straightforward option is given in the menu ‘Convert to Video.’ Go to the replay that you would like to save. Look at the right down corner and click on the ‘Convert to Video’ option.![video-quality-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-quality1.jpg)

Tips: Within the video conversion settings, you can include information about the display, music, sound effects, and video quality of the replay. Check all these settings and select them the way you want your gameplay to be. Video quality is the most important thing to consider.

**Step 4:** Your gameplay will be converted to the video. In the videos section of the game menu, you will find all the videos that you have saved. Now power off your Switch and remove the SD card from your Switch. Connect the SD card with PC, it will appear in the folders shown below.

 **![saving-folder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-folder1.jpg)**

### 3\. Record your whole gameplay with Capture Card

Choose your capture card, connect it with Nintendo switch and your PC, you can capture the gameplay through a computer with the following steps:

* **Step 1:** Launch the democreator**,** hit **New Rocording**.![demo-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/demo-smash2.jpg)
* **Step 2:** Select screen area that you want to save.![demo-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/demo-smash1.jpg)
* **Step 3:** Hit microphone to choose from audio sources.
* **Step 4:** Hit the big red button, and you will start recording.

Part II: Edit Your Switch Game Video

* [**1\. Trim gameplay video within Nintendo Switch**](#part3)
* [**2\. Edit video game play with Filmora X**](#part4)

---

### 1\. Trim gameplay video within Nintendo Switch

Nintendo Switch allows you to trim video easily in album:

* **Step 1:** At the bottom right of the home interface, hit the ‘Album’ and then ‘All screenshots and videos.’
* **Step 2:** Find the gameplay that you want to edit, hit ‘Editing and Posting’ and then go to ‘Trim.’
* **Step 3:** Slide the marker to choose the start point and endpoint of the video.
* **Step 4:** When you feel good about the result, ‘save’ and the video will be saved as a new clip.

![zelda-trim](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zelda-trim.png)

### 2\. Edit gameplay with Filmora X

Filmora X is a multipurpose video editing tool that can be used to edit your videos in the best possible way. One way is to edit the gaming montage is by editing it to the beat and the other is the speed control. Beat detection by beat marker is done by software automatically and adjusted with the video. Speed control is the key element here and adjusts it with the video. Adjust the speed by adjusting the duration. You can also add effects such as clinches to the video while adjusting the speed.

#### **Conclusion**

The gamers are always looking for ways to record the Nintendo Switch gameplay whether it requires them with capture card or without it. It is quite difficult to stream the Nintendo switch but it actually works in favor of gamers because there is quite low competition in video gameplay. The Nintendo gamers have big loyal viewer base and they serve as the best source for the new streamers who want to grow their channel quickly.
