The production of visually impressive videos, you'll be proud to share on your YouTube channel or any other video sharing web-based platform, often means that you'll have to create a lot of footage, although most of it will not make the final cut. Organizing footage and knowing exactly where a certain shot is in that sea of unsorted material will increase your efficiency during the post-production period, thus enabling you to shorten the amount of time you have to spend editing it.

Markers can be used during the video editing and after the screen recording to make post-production, to help you mark the places in the footage where you've made a mistake, where the new take starts or to indicate a spot on the timeline where you would like to place a particular video clip. In this article, we are going to show you how to utilize markers during the screen capturing sessions or while you're [editing videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with Filmora.

## Distinctions Between the Two Types of Markers

Watching the footage you've captured over and over can be a tiresome process that consumes both time and energy, so in order to increase your efficiency during the process of capturing and editing videos, you can simply add markers both to the files you're creating while recording or to your project's timeline.

The **media markers** are the markers you can add directly to the video file you are creating with Filmora during the screen recording session. You won't be able to see these markers until the video clip is imported into the software's video editor and placed on the timeline.

You can use them to mark a place in the screen recording you're not too happy with, or to highlight the part of the video clip that you intend on featuring in the final cut of the video you've created with Wondershare's screen capturing and screen recording software. By doing so you'll save time on going through all the material just to find a few seconds of footage that fit perfectly to your video.

![Filmora Scrn Markers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-markers.jpg)

The **timeline markers**, on the other hand, can only be added to a project once you've completed the recording session, during the post-production period. You can utilize them to highlight the parts of the video clip you want to remove from the final version of your video or to mark the spots on the timeline where you'd like to switch from one take to another.

This type of marker is immensely useful if you want to organize the timeline in your project better and to know exactly where every clip you want to use in your video is located at all times. Besides being a highly efficient tool for organizing vast amounts of footage, timeline markers can also help you denote the beats in the audio file and then sync the video clip perfectly to the beat of the tune you're using as a soundtrack to your video.

The production of visually impressive videos, you'll be proud to share on your YouTube channel or any other video sharing web-based platform, often means that you'll have to create a lot of footage, although most of it will not make the final cut. Organizing footage and knowing exactly where a certain shot is in that sea of unsorted material will increase your efficiency during the post-production period, thus enabling you to shorten the amount of time you have to spend editing it.

Markers can be used during the video editing and after the screen recording to make post-production, to help you mark the places in the footage where you've made a mistake, where the new take starts or to indicate a spot on the timeline where you would like to place a particular video clip. In this article, we are going to show you how to utilize markers during the screen capturing sessions or while you're [editing videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with Filmora.

## Distinctions Between the Two Types of Markers

Watching the footage you've captured over and over can be a tiresome process that consumes both time and energy, so in order to increase your efficiency during the process of capturing and editing videos, you can simply add markers both to the files you're creating while recording or to your project's timeline.

The **media markers** are the markers you can add directly to the video file you are creating with Filmora during the screen recording session. You won't be able to see these markers until the video clip is imported into the software's video editor and placed on the timeline.

You can use them to mark a place in the screen recording you're not too happy with, or to highlight the part of the video clip that you intend on featuring in the final cut of the video you've created with Wondershare's screen capturing and screen recording software. By doing so you'll save time on going through all the material just to find a few seconds of footage that fit perfectly to your video.

![Filmora Scrn Markers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-markers.jpg)

The **timeline markers**, on the other hand, can only be added to a project once you've completed the recording session, during the post-production period. You can utilize them to highlight the parts of the video clip you want to remove from the final version of your video or to mark the spots on the timeline where you'd like to switch from one take to another.

This type of marker is immensely useful if you want to organize the timeline in your project better and to know exactly where every clip you want to use in your video is located at all times. Besides being a highly efficient tool for organizing vast amounts of footage, timeline markers can also help you denote the beats in the audio file and then sync the video clip perfectly to the beat of the tune you're using as a soundtrack to your video.
