## Part 3: How to Record Google Meet as a Participant?

Everything presented on Google Meet can be recorded with an operational screen display and a working microphone. Like other video conferencing applications, Google Meet also allows participants to record Google Meet activities if the administrator enables the recording feature. So, it doesn't matter whether you are hosting a meeting or not; the video meeting can still be recorded if you join the conference as a participant. If you are wondering how to record a Google meet activity, let's look at the simple steps below.

#### Step 1: Join the meeting

Join the meeting session through the invitation link or enter the meeting code in the box next to the start meeting option.
