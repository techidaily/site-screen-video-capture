## Part 2: How to Record Skype Meeting on Windows

Skype for Business allows you to record skype meetings on Windows PCs directly from its app. It’s an easy and straightforward method of recording your meeting and I’ll go through every step to show you how you can record your next Skype meeting.

* [**Download Skype for Business**](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/download-and-install-skype-for-business-on-windows-2da94a13-6d16-4d67-adf3-439f2b946994) to your computer and sign in with your business account.
* Once you start or enter a meeting you can see the “More Options” button, press it, and select the “Start Recording” option. If the recording option is dimmed for you, your audio may not be connected. Press the mic icon to enable the audio and try again.

![start recording option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-recording-option3.jpg)

* Once you start the recording you can see the recording controls at the bottom of the meeting to pause, resume, or stop the recording.

![recording control](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recording-control4.jpg)

* You can check who is recording the Skype meeting by pointing to the red recording button on the top right corner of the Skype meeting. When one or any of the participants is recording the Skype for Business meeting all the other participants will see this indicator.

* Skype for Business saves the recording automatically in an MP4 format that is compatible with Windows Media Player. The recording takes some time to process the meanwhile you can exit the meeting. Skype will show a notification when the recorded file is ready for viewing or sharing.

## Part 3: How to Record Skype Meeting on Mac

According to [**Microsoft guidelines**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/clients-and-devices/desktop-feature-comparison?redirectedfrom=MSDN), Microsoft has yet to introduce the recording feature to its Mac version of Skype for Business. Recording on Mac has not been made available.

![no mac recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/no-mac-recording8.jpg)

Here you can try third-party software to record skype meeting. Wondershare Filmora is an amazing tool for video content creators and the general public at large that can be used to record Skype meeting with its flexible recording features.
