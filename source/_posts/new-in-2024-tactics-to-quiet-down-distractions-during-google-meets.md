## Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?

If they click that same button again, they will be unmuted.

![Google Meet unmute](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unmute-yourself-google-meet.jpg)

However, if they do not want to make use of the screen to mute and unmute, they can use keyboard key shortcuts. For Mac users, the relevant keys are CTRL - COMMAND - M. If you are making use of a different desktop or laptop then it is simply CTRL - M.

## Part 3: How to Mute Someone in Google Meet?

There are times when individuals are not aware that the background noise of their surroundings is causing a disturbance in the meeting. That is when muting someone can come in handy! Basically in this, a host or other participants in the meeting can mute an individual based on need. However, there is an eligibility criterion they must adhere to in order to get the muting permissions.

### The Eligibility Criteria To Mute Someone in Google Meet

Before looking into **how to mute someone on Google Meet**, check if any of the following scenarios apply to you,

* Google Meet calls made through Google workspace accounts only permit a person, from the domain which organized the meeting, to mute a participant.
* During a video call arranged by using an educational Google account, only the individual who has created the meeting / is the owner of a calendar can mute other individuals.

So, if any of these circumstances apply to you, then you can easily mute someone in a Google Meet session. The process involves the following steps,

Click onto a participant’s picture and click Mute or if this step is not working for you, then at the bottom right of your video room on Google Meet, click people , once you do that a menu will appear on the side of your screen.

Click on the arrow next to the name of the person you would like to mute. Once you do that, a drop-down menu will appear with three options.

## Part 3: How to Mute Someone in Google Meet?

There are times when individuals are not aware that the background noise of their surroundings is causing a disturbance in the meeting. That is when muting someone can come in handy! Basically in this, a host or other participants in the meeting can mute an individual based on need. However, there is an eligibility criterion they must adhere to in order to get the muting permissions.

### The Eligibility Criteria To Mute Someone in Google Meet

Before looking into **how to mute someone on Google Meet**, check if any of the following scenarios apply to you,

* During video calls that are hosted through personal Google accounts, only the moderator can mute a person.
* Google Meet calls made through Google workspace accounts only permit a person, from the domain which organized the meeting, to mute a participant.
* During a video call arranged by using an educational Google account, only the individual who has created the meeting / is the owner of a calendar can mute other individuals.

So, if any of these circumstances apply to you, then you can easily mute someone in a Google Meet session. The process involves the following steps,

Click onto a participant’s picture and click Mute or if this step is not working for you, then at the bottom right of your video room on Google Meet, click people , once you do that a menu will appear on the side of your screen.

Click on the arrow next to the name of the person you would like to mute. Once you do that, a drop-down menu will appear with three options.

Click the microphone button in the middle, and once a cross appears on the mic, the individual will be muted.

## Part 4: How to Mute All Participants in Google Meet?

Want to convey your message to everyone without having some interrupt you and have you lose your train? Mute everyone!

Important Note: Host Management should be turned on prior to the commencement of the meeting to use the Google Meet Mute option to mute all participants at the same time. Additionally, the Google Meet mute all function is only available for Educational accounts and it can only be used by meeting creators and owners of the calendars.

At the button right of your Google Meet window, click on “people” and then click the “Mute all” button.

**Side note:** Once a participant is muted, they do have the option to manually unmute themselves, so remember that.

## Part 5: Best Chrome Extensions to Mute Everyone in Google Meet

Well, it’s not like everyone has an educational Google account through which they can access the mute all feature, so what do those individuals do. They can get themselves some of the best chrome extensions which allow them to use the mute all option without creating an educational Google account.

Take a look at these extensions which will enable you to mute Google Meet participants all at once!
