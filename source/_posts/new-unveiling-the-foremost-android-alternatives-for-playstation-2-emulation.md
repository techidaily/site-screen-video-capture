You'll need to have a PlayStation 2 BIOS in order to run certain emulators like DamonPS2 Pro, for example. On Google, you may also download this file and put it into the app's folder. It's now possible to choose a game to play after having BIOS installed. The PS2 BIOS will then be requested. Return to tapping the game after selecting the BIOS file. After you've done this, all you have to do is wait for the program to load so that you can begin playing.

## Conclusions

The development of ps2 emulator for android is ongoing. A ps2 emulator for android won't work properly unless you have the right hardware. Until these applications are completely functioning and ready for everyone, they aren't ready for use.

The greatest ps2 emulator for android so far is DamonPS2 Pro, one of the three apps on our list. Compared to Play! and PPSS2 Golden, it has less trouble with most PS2 games. It also has the most devoted following and is the closest to a fully functional PS2 emulator for Android on the market at the moment.

All of these applications, however, are still in the early stages of development. For all these years, you've been pleading for an Android phone with a PS2 emulator so you can play your favorite games on it.
