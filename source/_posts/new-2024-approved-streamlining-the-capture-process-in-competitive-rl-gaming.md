However, there are reports from gamers that when you record your LOL games through Windows Game Bar, the game performance can lag at times. If that is not the case with you, you can use Windows Game Bar to capture screenshots and record gameplay in simple steps.

Step 1: Press Windows + G keys and you will see Windows Game Bar on your screen.

Step 2: Open LOL game on your computer and start playing the game. Press Windows + Alt + R keys together to start recording LOL gameplay.

Step 3: You can stop recording anytime by pressing Windows + Alt + R together again.

You can find the recorded video by going to Widgets and then to Gallery section.
