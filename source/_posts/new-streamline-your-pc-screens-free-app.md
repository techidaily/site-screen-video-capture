Step 2: Adjust the recording window

There are three window types to consider: Custom, Fullscreen, and Target. Videos may be streamed on any website due to Filmora's ability to adjust the file size and quality to match user expectations. Its user interface gives you total control over your project, including the ability to change your timeline.

Step 3: Custom the settings

You may choose a full-screen mode from the custom menu to capture your screen activity in the highest quality possible. For the upcoming Screen casting sessions, you may modify the settings here. The Screen Recorder allows you to capture video and audio.

Step 4: Record your screen

Record your screen with Wondershare Filmora from the Screen Recorder's left side. A rectangle icon will appear, allowing you to choose where a portion of the screen you wish to record. You may press the Record button once all of the parameters have been specified. To begin recording, it will offer you a 3-second buffer time.

## Wrapping Up

In this digital era, there are a plethora of screen recording applications available on the market. In addition, we addressed the most straightforward and dependable method of recording displays of simple screen recorder windows.

Alternatively, if you have specific needs for on-screen recordings, such as the ability to edit online while recording, we propose Filmora as a simple screen recorder for windows option. Everyone's requirements for screen recording are unique; thus, we must choose the most appropriate screen recorder for each individual based on their requirements.
