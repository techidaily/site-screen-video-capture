Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder.

## Part 3\. The Editor’s Review

Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.

Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.

Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.

Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.

## Part 4\. Other Alternative to Record Screen on Windows 10
