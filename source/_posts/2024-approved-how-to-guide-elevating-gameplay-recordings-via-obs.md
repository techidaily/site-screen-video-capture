## Part 3\. Best OBS Alternatives to Record Games

If you are not comfortable with OBS and you are looking for a professional gameplay recording with a proper video editor, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora Recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can record gameplay with webcam and mic so that you can showcase your gaming screen along with your reactions and commentary. In general, you cannot upload your gameplay straight away on online platforms. You have to edit out the boring parts and add some effects from better aesthetic value.

Filmora comes with a built-in video editor where you can trim and crop, add audio and video effects, change green screen background, add texts and logos and much more. Naturally, such an edited video will get traction immediately over any straightforward gameplay recording. The first step is to download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.
