## Part 3\. The Editor’s Review

Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.

Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.

Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.

Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.

## Part 4\. Other Alternative to Record Screen on Windows 10

If you are not satisfied with the video quality and certain features that Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 has to offer, you can opt for better alternatives. Here are the best alternatives to record screen on Windows 10.

### Filmora

Wondershare Filmora is a professional [screen recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that has a built-in video editor.

![wondershare screen recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-recording-screen.jpg)

Most importantly, you can capture at 4K resolution and you can add voiceover if you want. As far as the editor goes, you can add sound effects, video effects, transitions, and filters. Moreover, you can insert captions, drawings, and stickers and you can do green screen recording. Therefore, Filmora scores over Screen Recorder Pro on various parameters. Here is the list of all the features Filmora offers.

**Key Features –**
