#### 2\. What is the best Zoom alternative for teaching?

Best Zoom Alternative for teaching will always be an application that allows the participation of many attendees. Plus, it should also facilitate class activities, such as presentations, file sharing. Last but not least, it must also enable teachers to record video sessions to help students revise online lectures. Google Meet, GoTo Meeting, and a few are options that provide educators an ideal environment to conduct classes.

#### 3\. What is the best Zoom alternative for musicians?

Musicians cannot compromise on video and audio quality during their music recordings. Plus, they also freak out when video lags or jitters. So, they prefer applications with minimal noise distortion and robust mechanisms to deal with background noise. LANDR, Discord, and Reapers are the few **Zoom alternatives** for musicians

**Conclusion**

The contribution of Zoom to changing the digital landscape cannot be denied. The outbreak of Covid-19 has also led to a surge in the use of video-conferencing applications, especially Zoom. However, this does not mean that Zoom will fit all requirements. If you are bored of Zoom’s interface or want to host meetings for more than 40 minutes, switching **to Zoom alternatives** is not a bad thing. The above-mentioned video communication platforms will help you make a choice if you are looking for other options.
