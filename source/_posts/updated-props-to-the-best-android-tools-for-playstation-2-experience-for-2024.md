You'll need to have a PlayStation 2 BIOS in order to run certain emulators like DamonPS2 Pro, for example. On Google, you may also download this file and put it into the app's folder. It's now possible to choose a game to play after having BIOS installed. The PS2 BIOS will then be requested. Return to tapping the game after selecting the BIOS file.
