## Preserving Your Virtual Sessions: GoToMeeting Tips

GoToMeeting is a web conferencing software that enables users to hold online meetings for 250 people. Users may meet face to face, communicate with associates via in-meeting chatting or conference call, & share their presentations via screen sharing.

Meetings may be accessed via a PC, Mac, iOS, or Android device. All GoToMeeting sessions (also known as webinars) can be recorded. This article explains how to record a **gotomeeting recording** session in detail, including a step-by-step approach.

Part 1. [How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder](#part1)

Part 2. [Use the Best GoToMeeting Recorder on PC](#part2)

Part 3. [Record GoToMeeting with an Online Recorder](#part3)

Part 4. [Record GoToMeeting on iPhone and Android](#part4)

## Part 1\. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder

Meetings can be recorded using the built-in **gotomeeting recording** option, but there are limits.

However, recording options must be set up before the commencement of the session. You can only record meetings using GoToMeeting's meeting recorder if you have a premium account and admin authorization, making it a much less convenient option to record meetings.

Step 1\. Just click over the "REC" icon at the top of the GoToMeeting screen once you have joined a meeting to record.

![gotomeeting start record](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-start-record.jpg)

Step 2\. While recording, click "Start Your Recording," and the "REC" icon will become red. The recording of the meeting will be announced to all participants.

Step 3\. Click over the "REC" icon and choose "Stop Your Recording" to stop the recording. If you're making a local recording, the Recording Manager will open up and ask you to convert the video. However, if you're doing a cloud recording, you'll be sent to your online account to retrieve the footage. It takes some time for new recordings to appear in the cloud recording history.

Step 4\. However, what if other participants, such as not account owners or organizers, wish to record live sessions? In this instance, you'll need a video-recording program that works on both PCs and Macs.

## Part 2\. Use the Best GoToMeeting Recorder on PC

## Part 4\. Record GoToMeeting on iPhone and Android

Now that we've covered how to do a **gotomeeting recording** on a PC, it's time to talk about how to do it on an iOS or Android smartphone. There are different recording solutions available on the market when it comes to screen recorders for phones. DU Screen Recorder is one of them, and you may already be familiar with it. It's a popular free screen recorder for smartphones since it allows users to record high-quality recordings for free. In addition, there are several video and picture editing options.

**For Android:**

You can record GoToMeeting meetings on Android by using the DU Screen Recorder application. To begin, go to the Google Play Store and download the DU Screen Recorder application from there.

* There are settings for video quality and resolution for recording on Android devices, recording audio, showing touch, sharing recordings, and more.
* With DU Screen Recorder, click the left-hand "Record" button to record anything, including video tutorials, gaming, and other activities.

**For iOS:**

To begin, go to the App Store and get DU Screen Recorder. Using DU Screen Recorder for iOS to record the screen on an iPhone is similar to using Apple's own built-in screen recording feature.

* Firstly, on your iPhone/iPad, install DU Recorder. Then navigate to Control Center, Customize Controls, and then Settings. Add Screen Recording to your Control Center by finding it and clicking on it.
* Your Control Center should now be open. Hold the Record icon down for a long time. If necessary, activate your Microphone and choose the DU Recorder Live option. Begin taping.

## Wrapping UP

Simply follow the easy instructions above to capture your **gotomeeting recording** on PC, iOS, or Android. You may begin by using a built-in utility and then go to different applications as your needs change.
