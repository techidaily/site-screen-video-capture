For example, you can call the teacher who teaches you to make perfect ramen a "sifu."

After preparing for eight years to take vengeance, finally, the day has arrived. He will not stop until he takes down all his rivals, whoever comes in his way toward his revenge. He can overcome death with the help of a magical pendant whenever he dies. But this return from death has a cost to be paid in the form of age. Whenever he comes back to life, he becomes older.
