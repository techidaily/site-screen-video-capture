### OBS

[OBS Studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an extremely popular screen recording software and it is particularly popular among video streamers. This is because it is the best platform through which video creators share live streaming of their screens or gameplays on Twitch and YouTube. The software is compatible with Windows, macOS as well as Linux. You can capture high-quality screen video and you can edit the video like a pro.

![obs recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-screen-recorder.jpg)

The video effects and transitions are plenty and you can set filters to record noise-free audio. There are various configurations available to experiment with for better quality recording as per requirements. All in all, if you are looking for professional-quality screen recording to upload on various video streaming platforms, OBS Studio is a great choice.

### Xbox Game Bar

If you do not want to install a third-party app and you prefer a Microsoft app for screen recording, Windows already comes with built-in app called [Xbox Game Bar](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a standard screen recording utility tool that is extremely handy in capturing screen as well as gameplay. It is completely free to use and you can operate it completely with keyboard shortcuts. It stays in the background and continuously records whatever there is on the screen.

It does not take up too much system resources and it does not drag down the performance of the application or the game whose screen is being recorded. You can capture screenshots and record audio from different sources. There are various configuration settings available to tweak and record screen as per your requirements. It stays on the screen as a widget with important options to execute instantly.

## The Bottom Line

If you are confused if you should install Screen Recorder Pro to record your screen, well, you should go for it as all the standard features and functionalities are available. However, if you are looking for capturing gameplay, you have to opt for an alternative such as Wondershare Filmora. But for basic screen recording, you do not even need Screen recorder Pro as Xbox Game Bar will suffice which comes installed for Windows 10 users.
