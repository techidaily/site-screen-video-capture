## Way 3\. Record LOL Games with Windows Game Bar

Therefore, there is no need for any external gameplay recorder. However, there are reports from gamers that when you record your LOL games through Windows Game Bar, the game performance can lag at times. If that is not the case with you, you can use Windows Game Bar to capture screenshots and record gameplay in simple steps.
