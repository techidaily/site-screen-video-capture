## Way 4\. Record VR Gameplay on PS4

There is no doubt that playing VR games is more fun on gaming consoles than on computers.

If you use PlayStation 4 as your VR console, you can use the built-in recording option on PS4 to record virtual reality gameplay. Here are the steps you need to follow minutely.

![ps 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-recording-duration-ps4.jpg)

Step 6: If you want to stop recording manually, press Share button twice.

You will find the recorded clips under Capture Gallery option.

## Way 5\. Use Nvidia to Record VR Games

If you have a gaming computer and you are using Nvidia graphic card, you can record VR games using VR game recorder ShadowPlay.
