## Visionary Tech That Cares for the Earth

The VFX method, known as "green screen", involves the layering or composite of two pictures or video streams. Editors often erase the shot's original backdrop to insert surreal or otherworldly ones. Simply said, you're creating the illusion of a single picture by superimposing one image or video stream on top of another.

Applications that may be used to modify the backdrop of a video are known as [green screen software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The video timeline may be simply edited and trimmed utilising this application. They provide you with the option of changing the backdrop color of the video clip. Many of these tools let you record video with virtual background without green screen.

## Part 1\. Why use Green Screen in Recordings

Your film has to stand out from the crowd to be successful in the increasingly crowded video marketing and production field. A green screen is an excellent tool for enhancing the quality of your multimedia production. Here are some of the advantages of using a green screen recording.

Professional Backgrounds: Anyone may create a clean, professional-looking backdrop for their films by using a digital background set-up. Due to the highly competitive nature of video marketing and content creation, it is now more crucial than ever to ensure that your video stands out from the rest.

Portability: In that regard, the green screen's mobility is quite beneficial. There isn't much to it after you learn how to light your recording green screen and subject. You may carry it anywhere you want.

Save time: The freedom to film where you want, when you want is one of the critical benefits of a green screen. It eliminates the need for additional manufacturing time and gives you a single place with endless options.

It's Affordable: The freedom to film where you want, when you want is one of the critical benefits of a green screen.

## Part 2\. Best Green Screen Recorders

When you need to film in a place that you can't physically visit, a green screen may be a convenient tool. A green screen may also be used for more practical reasons such as money and travel time. The following are some of the top green screen recording apps for videographers and multimedia creators:
