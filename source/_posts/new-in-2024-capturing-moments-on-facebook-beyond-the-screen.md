## Way 3\. How to Record Facebook Live on iPhone

Screencasts on iOS devices, such as the iPhone and iPad, are often done through third-party applications. However, for those who prefer a more direct method, the iOS 11 or 12 versions have a handy built-in screen recording option. However, before you can utilize this function, you must first enable it. You've come to the correct spot if you're wondering how to record Facebook videos on your iPhone. We'll now look at how you can do each of these tasks with ease. We'll be utilizing an app for that.
