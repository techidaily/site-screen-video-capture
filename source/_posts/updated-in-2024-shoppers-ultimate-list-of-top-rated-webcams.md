Essentially, a webcam is a video camera, that works as an input device for computers. It captures either still pictures or motion videos of users, which can then be uploaded or streamed via the internet. Today, most laptops come with a built-in webcam, embedded into the display. Other webcams are small cameras that either attach to a monitor or sit on a desk and connect to a computer’s USB or FireWire port. Unlike a traditional digital camera, a webcam doesn’t have any built-in storage. Rather a webcam must always be connected to a computer, which it uses for storage.

In this buyer’s guide, we will introduce the 10 best webcams for your PC or Mac based on your budget and needs.

Its **unidirectional microphone** has automatic acoustic **noise-cancellation** and its **universal attachment base** makes it compatible with desktops, laptops and notebooks. At just $25, it is the best budget webcam on this list and an ideal entry-level webcam.

#### 3. [AUSDOM 1080P HD](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=ausdom+1080p+hd&tag=googhydr-21&index=aps&hvadid=239831977374&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7183395649079703283&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9046875&hvtargid=kwd-311706422638&ref=pd%5Fsl%5Fulqb2bp55%5Fe) \[**Best Budget Full HD Webcam** \]

If you want a full HD webcam without the full HD webcam price, this camera is for you. The **1080p HD camera** can capture video in the best resolution, ideal for Skype. It also has a **noise-cancelling microphone** and **low-light compensation**. Although, there’s no autofocus and you don’t get much other software. However, the **USB 3.0/USB 2.0 Connector** gives it straightforward **plug-and-play capabilities**. We love how easy this webcam has been made to use, and the low-price makes up for any shortcomings.

#### 4. [Logitech C270](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/hd-webcam-c270)\[**Best Budget Webcam for Mac** \]

**Pros:**

* Great for the price
* Very easy to install

**Cons:**

* 720p only
* Doesn’t integrate with Windows 7

Logitech has the most options of any manufacturer, essentially selling a webcam at each $10 interval. If you’re a business type or an active Skype user, but you’re trying to spend as little as possible, you might want to check out the Logitech C270 instead of the Microsoft LifeCam. Enjoy **HD 720p video calling** with Skype, Google Hangouts, Zoom and other popular instant messaging applications. You can snap straightforward **3-megapixel pictures** and features **Logitech’s Fluid Crystal Tech**.

If you’re gaming on the go its **fold-and-go design**, short USB cable and its light .55-pound weight make it easy to take your webcam with you. However, for just $10 more you can get the C920, which is a better camera even without the fold-and-go design.

#### 6. [Besteker 1536P Full HD](https://www.amazon.com/Webcam-Besteker-Microphones-Widescreen-Facial-enhancement/dp/B073NZZF7R) \[**Best Budget Webcam for Video Quality** \]

This **plug-and-play** full HD camera is compatible with all Windows or Mac computers and supports Chrome OS and TV Box Android 5.0\. It also works well with OBS studio for YouTube or Twitch streaming. This camera would be a fantastic choice for video marketers!

#### 7. [Creative Labs Senz3D](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-73VF081000000-BlasterX-Senz3D/dp/B01J2SDB4M) \[**The Best Quality Webcam** \]

The **3D gesture controls** and **face sensing** open new possibilities for game development for both professionals and amateurs alike. The **effortless background removal tech** and **fantastic noise-cancellation microphone** will also make this a favourite for gamers. The camera works on all platforms; however, it is debatable how much of the new features most gamers will be using.

#### 8. [**Logitech 4K Pro**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=logitech+4k+pro+webcam&index=aps&tag=googhydr-21&ref=pd%5Fsl%5F5f2r62abgq%5Fe&adgrpid=59977001904&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=259121289280&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14806622530510668825&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9046579&hvtargid=kwd-321913244574) \[**Best HD Webcam** \]

**Cons:**

* Expensive
* The clip is a step down from the C920

The [Logitech 4K Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) was the **world’s first 4K webcam**. This camera is perfect for pro-gamers, allowing them to produce **professional-quality videos**. The 4K Pro is packed with other features such as **RightLight tech with HDR** for recording in low-light environments, **infrared facial recognition** and **5x digital zoom**. Unfortunately, unlike the C920 the 4K Pro’s clip doesn’t hold tight to the display. However, if you can compromise with that, then the 4K Pro streams some of the highest quality videos you’ll find right now if you have the software to support 4K!

#### 9. [Mevo](https://www.amazon.com/Mevo-Camera-select-Android-devices/dp/B01G6BIN8C) \[**Best Webcam for Livestreaming on the Go** \]

Essentially, a webcam is a video camera, that works as an input device for computers. It captures either still pictures or motion videos of users, which can then be uploaded or streamed via the internet. Today, most laptops come with a built-in webcam, embedded into the display. Other webcams are small cameras that either attach to a monitor or sit on a desk and connect to a computer’s USB or FireWire port. Unlike a traditional digital camera, a webcam doesn’t have any built-in storage. Rather a webcam must always be connected to a computer, which it uses for storage.

In this buyer’s guide, we will introduce the 10 best webcams for your PC or Mac based on your budget and needs.

## Top 10 Best Webcams in 2024 for Different Purposes & Budgets

#### 1. [**Logitech C920**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=logitech+c920&index=aps&tag=googhydr-21&ref=pd%5Fsl%5F82x88ir7k8%5Fe&adgrpid=54863525658&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=259034839917&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=150271054539053642&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9046875&hvtargid=kwd-296498663229)\[The Best Overall Webcam\]

![ webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-c920.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Excellent 1080p HD video in multiple lighting conditions
* 360-degree swivel based
* Good auto-focus and image adjustment features
* Cost-effective

 **Cons:**

* The audio can occasionally be muffled
* No RealSense capabilities

Still, in 2018, the Logitech C920 is the best overall webcam for streaming. Connect with your friends in **Full HD 1080p on Skype**, or in **720p on FaceTime for Macs**. Full HD recording is made possible by Logitech’s advanced compression tech, . It eradicates time-consuming compression to speed-up uploads and reduces the demand on your processor. The **five-element glass lens** captures real-to-life images, while the autofocus feature adjusts to provide a consistent high definition. Great value at **$51!**

#### 2. [Microsoft LifeCam HD 3000](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=microsoft+lifecam+hd+3000&index=aps&tag=googhydr-21&ref=pd%5Fsl%5F742sd5muyp%5Fe&adgrpid=53622398536&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=259121388865&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8771406454265355061&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9046875&hvtargid=kwd-301753658781) \[The Best Budget Webcam\]

![ webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lifecam-studio.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Cheap, fantastic value for money
* Flexible camera head
* Fantastic usability

**Cons:**

* 720p only
* Auto-focus can be temperamental

If you want something cheap and cheerful for Skype or Messenger, then Microsoft's LifeCam range offers good performance at a low price. It records and streams **720p HD video** and accommodates recording in **16:9 widescreen**. The **TrueColor tech** automatically delivers bright videos in all lighting conditions. Its **unidirectional microphone** has automatic acoustic **noise-cancellation** and its **universal attachment base** makes it compatible with desktops, laptops and notebooks. At just $25, it is the best budget webcam on this list and an ideal entry-level webcam.

#### 3. [AUSDOM 1080P HD](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=ausdom+1080p+hd&tag=googhydr-21&index=aps&hvadid=239831977374&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7183395649079703283&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9046875&hvtargid=kwd-311706422638&ref=pd%5Fsl%5Fulqb2bp55%5Fe) \[**Best Budget Full HD Webcam** \]

![ webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ausdom-af225-webcam.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Full HD for a great price
* Automatic noise-reduction

**Cons:**

* No auto-focus
* Doesn’t work well with Windows 10

If you want a full HD webcam without the full HD webcam price, this camera is for you. The **1080p HD camera** can capture video in the best resolution, ideal for Skype. It also has a **noise-cancelling microphone** and **low-light compensation**. Although, there’s no autofocus and you don’t get much other software. However, the **USB 3.0/USB 2.0 Connector** gives it straightforward **plug-and-play capabilities**. We love how easy this webcam has been made to use, and the low-price makes up for any shortcomings.

#### 4. [Logitech C270](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/hd-webcam-c270)\[**Best Budget Webcam for Mac** \]

**Pros:**

* Great for the price
* Very easy to install

**Cons:**

* 720p only
* Doesn’t integrate with Windows 7

Logitech has the most options of any manufacturer, essentially selling a webcam at each $10 interval. If you’re a business type or an active Skype user, but you’re trying to spend as little as possible, you might want to check out the Logitech C270 instead of the Microsoft LifeCam. Enjoy **HD 720p video calling** with Skype, Google Hangouts, Zoom and other popular instant messaging applications. You can snap straightforward **3-megapixel pictures** and features **Logitech’s Fluid Crystal Tech**.

#### 5. [**Logitech C615**](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Laptop-Webcam-Design-360-Degree/dp/B004YW7WCY) \[**Best Budget Webcam for Gaming** \]

**Pros:**

* HD video at a non-HD price
* Tripod compatible
* Very portable

**Cons:**

* Short USB cord can interfere with placement
* For a little more you can get a C920

If you are an avid gamer, the Logitech C615 offers the best image quality available for under $50\. You can **record HD 1080p videos** and **video chat in widescreen HD 720p**, making streaming game feeds easy. It has a **360-degree full range** of motion**, premium auto-focus** and features **Logitech’s Fluid Crystal Tech**. If you’re gaming on the go its **fold-and-go design**, short USB cable and its light .55-pound weight make it easy to take your webcam with you. However, for just $10 more you can get the C920, which is a better camera even without the fold-and-go design.

#### 6. [Besteker 1536P Full HD](https://www.amazon.com/Webcam-Besteker-Microphones-Widescreen-Facial-enhancement/dp/B073NZZF7R) \[**Best Budget Webcam for Video Quality** \]

**Pros:**

* Outstanding 1526P Full HD resolution
* Good video compression tech

**Cons:**

* No auto-focus
* Issues connecting to a USB 3.0 connector

With **1526p Full HD resolution**, compatible up to **2048x1536 resolutions**, and **30 FPS** this webcam has outstanding video quality for its price. The **Full HD Carl Zeiss standard 6 element optical glass lens** further enhances the images, while the **advanced  video compression tech** gives your videos fast, smooth uploads without disrupting your Internet connection. This **plug-and-play** full HD camera is compatible with all Windows or Mac computers and supports Chrome OS and TV Box Android 5.0\. It also works well with OBS studio for YouTube or Twitch streaming. This camera would be a fantastic choice for video marketers!

#### 7. [Creative Labs Senz3D](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-73VF081000000-BlasterX-Senz3D/dp/B01J2SDB4M) \[**The Best Quality Webcam** \]

**Pros:**

* Packed with features
* Effortless background removal
* RealSense capabilities

**Cons:**

* Expensive
* Unsupported features

The Senz3D is more than just a webcam. With the integration of **Intel’s RealSense capabilities** and **FastAccess 3D,** this is the webcam of the future. The camera can integrate with Windows Hello for hands-free login. The **3D gesture controls** and **face sensing** open new possibilities for game development for both professionals and amateurs alike. The **effortless background removal tech** and **fantastic noise-cancellation microphone** will also make this a favourite for gamers. The camera works on all platforms; however, it is debatable how much of the new features most gamers will be using.

#### 8. [**Logitech 4K Pro**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=logitech+4k+pro+webcam&index=aps&tag=googhydr-21&ref=pd%5Fsl%5F5f2r62abgq%5Fe&adgrpid=59977001904&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=259121289280&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14806622530510668825&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9046579&hvtargid=kwd-321913244574) \[**Best HD Webcam** \]

![ webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-4k-pro-webcam.jpg)

**Pros:**

* 4K streaming
* Fantastic low-light capabilities
* Premium audio

**Cons:**

* Expensive
* The clip is a step down from the C920

The [Logitech 4K Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) was the **world’s first 4K webcam**. This camera is perfect for pro-gamers, allowing them to produce **professional-quality videos**. The 4K Pro is packed with other features such as **RightLight tech with HDR** for recording in low-light environments, **infrared facial recognition** and **5x digital zoom**. Unfortunately, unlike the C920 the 4K Pro’s clip doesn’t hold tight to the display. However, if you can compromise with that, then the 4K Pro streams some of the highest quality videos you’ll find right now if you have the software to support 4K!

#### 9. [Mevo](https://www.amazon.com/Mevo-Camera-select-Android-devices/dp/B01G6BIN8C) \[**Best Webcam for Livestreaming on the Go** \]

**Pros:**

* 4K live streaming
* Compatible with mobile devices
* Extreme portability

**Cons:**

* Expensive pricing

This webcam was designed by the Livestream team and allows you to stream from anywhere to Livestream, Vimeo, Periscope, YouTube, Facebook Live and Twitter via Wi-Fi or LTE. The Mevo is small enough to fit in your pocket, yet it delivers a **premium streaming experience with 2160p 4K recording**. Mevo’s **Live Editing Suite** allows you to tap to cut, pinch to zoom or swipe to pan. Alternatively, you can enable autopilot and let **Mevo’s AI edit the videos for you**. For aspiring multimedia journalists, the Mevo is like having **a portable TV studio!**

#### 10. [Razer Kiyo](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kiyo-Streaming-Optimized-Built/dp/B075N1BYWB)\[**Best Webcam for Gaming and Streaming** \]

![ webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-kiyo-webcam.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Convenient ring-light
* 1080p HD streaming
* Designed for Twitch streamers

**Cons:**

* Expensive

The Kiyo is an innovative camera focussed on streaming. Razer is very popular with gamers and for this camera, Razer has stripped away all the unnecessary features that higher-end webcams claim and focus on good image quality and lighting with their special **Light Ring**. Their Light Ring is a new feature, with **twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens**. It can shoot **60 FPS at 720p and 30 FPS at Full HD 1080p.** The camera it also comes with **built-in support for Xsplit and OBS** making it ideal for gamers.

So, if you are looking for the best all-around webcam then the Logitech C920 is still the best on the market. It provides good performance at an excellent price. If you are looking for something a bit cheaper than the Microsoft LifeCam is the best webcam for PC and the Logitech C270 is the best for mac. For the professionals, the Creative Labs Senz3D is the most exclusive webcam, the Logitech 4K pro is the best HD webcam and the Mevo is the most portable.
