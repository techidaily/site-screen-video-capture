![ change zoom meeting background with video filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-background-video-filters.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the Video Filters tab, and you will come across multiple filters. Click on the filter that you want to use, and that's it.

Now you can conduct the meeting on Zoom using that video filter.

**Conclusion**

This is how you can use Snap Camera on Zoon. In case, **Snap Camera** is **not working on Zoom**, then try to force restart Snap Camera, ensure that your system meets the requirements to run Snap Camera, check if the webcam is turned on or not, and always choose the right webcam to enable Snap Camera. Other than that, using Snap Camera for Zoom meetings is incredibly easy, and you must try it out to add some personality to your video meetings, webinars, and video calls.

The most popular Snap Camera filter is the potato lens. Phil Walton has created this filter. Once you use it, you will find yourself underground, and your face will be replaced by a potato. However, the potato will have your eyes and mouth. To search for this filter, use the search bar and search for potato.

### 2\.  Cat Filters

![ best Snap Camera lens and filters - cat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snap-camera-cat-lens.jpg)

Another funny or rather an adorable filter to try is the cat filter. There is a multitude of cat filters available. You can check out the one that you like the most and try it out. This filter became popular after an awkward incident occurred during a virtual legal proceeding, where the advocate turned on the cat filter and appeared as a cat.

### 3\.  Cute Puppy Lens

![ best Snap Camera lens and filters - puppy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/puppy-snap-camera-lens.jpg)

### 4\.  Donut Glasses Lens

![ best Snap Camera lens and filters - donuts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snap-camera-donuts-lens.jpg)
