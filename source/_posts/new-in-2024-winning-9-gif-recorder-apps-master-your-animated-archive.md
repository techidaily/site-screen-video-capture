Screencasting on any version of Windows 7/8/10 is a simple task, and countless software products enable you to record your desktop activities.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

On the other hand, GIFs are small in size, and sending them via email or posting them on social media networks won't require you to wait for a long time until the file is uploaded to the web.

![GIF Screen Recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gif-screen-recorder.jpg)

If you are looking for a powerful screen recorder that offers easy-to-use screencasting tools, then this software is the right choice for you.

GIF Screen Recorder lets you customize the region of the screen you'd like to capture, and it enables you to select the length of the preferred frame rate of the recording.

Starting a new screencast requires you to designate the screen area by dragging a corner of a large red rectangle that appears on the screen when you launch the GIF Screen Recorder and hit the Record button.

The software also features the editing mode to add subtitles to your animated GIFs or export image frames.

#### 3. [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows XP or later, macOS 10.6 or later

Click on the Record button to capture the animated GIF file and save it on your hard drive. LICEcap enables you to save your GIFs in LCF and GIF file formats, but its file-sharing capabilities are next to non-existent.

**Compatibility:** Windows XP, 2003, Vista and 7

![fraps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps-movies-settings.jpg)

Fraps is probably one of the oldest screen recorders for gaming because it was released 18 years ago, and besides providing video capture features, it can also be used for benchmarking or displaying frame rates.

Fraps don't offer support for GIF files, which means that you can only use it to create an MP.4 or AVI file that you can later convert to GIF file format. Capturing videos and still frames outside of a video game is not on the list of options the software offers.

Make sure that the GIF file format is selected in the Save menu, and hit the Rec button to start capturing your animated GIF file.

When you want to stop recording, click on the Save button and choose the destination on your hard drive where the file will be saved.

#### 6. [ShareX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility** **:** Windows 7 or later

![sharex gif recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sharex-capture-screen-recording-option.jpg)

Screencasting on any version of Windows 7/8/10 is a simple task, and countless software products enable you to record your desktop activities.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

On the other hand, GIFs are small in size, and sending them via email or posting them on social media networks won't require you to wait for a long time until the file is uploaded to the web.

However, there aren't that many screen recorders for Windows OS that let you save screen recordings as GIF files, and for that reason, we've composed the list of best **GIF Recorders** for PCs. Let's have a look at some of the most powerful software products for creating animated GIFs on Windows.
