The online platform Wire is one of the best video calling apps for pcs. It takes a different approach from our list's other video calling apps. Rather than focusing on call quality and signal strength, they focus more intensely on the security side of things. The wire is, in effect, the best video calling app for pcs with Windows 10 if you want to be sure nobody can trace or watch your calls.

Wire’s Main Features

Some of the features that make Wire such a fantastic video calling app for pc (Windows 10) are:

* End-to-end encryption makes it a secure way to send videos without being traced.
* Group calls for up to 10 participants, video chatting at once!
* Very adaptive to network conditions – will run even on the poorest connection.
