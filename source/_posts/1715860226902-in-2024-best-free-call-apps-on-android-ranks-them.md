![ FaceTime Alternative: Google Duo ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-duo-video-calling-app.jpg)

Even though Google Duo was launched just three years ago, it is easily one of the best alternatives to FaceTime, as you can use this app on both iPhone and Android phones or from a web browser. The app’s been labeled as Android’s official response to FaceTime, as it allows its users to receive calls even if they don’t have it installed on their phones.

![ FaceTime Alternative: JusTalk Video Chat & Messenger  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/justalk-video-chat-messenger.jpg)

Users of this app can do much more than just video chat, even if they are using different types of Smartphones. JusTalk delivers HD quality of both voice and video calls on WiFi and 3G, 4G, and 5G networks.

The app also enables you to make group calls that **have 50 or fewer participants**  or create groups that have as many as 200 members.

![ FaceTime Alternative: Skype for iPhone  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-for-iphone-talk-chat-collaborate.jpg)

At the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic, the number of Skype’s users increased by 70% in a single month. This statistic alone speaks volumes about the app’s popularity, as millions of people choose to talk to their business associates or friends through Skype.

Besides being one of the most popular [cross-platform video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ever created, Skype is also remarkably easy to use, as you just need a webcam and a microphone to start a video call.

With a user base of more than 210 million people, Snapchat is easily one of the best video chat apps for Android and iPhones. Besides giving you the option to video chat with 16 friends at the same time, Snapchat also offers the possibility to send video snaps or photos that disappear just seconds after you sent them to all of your contacts.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it. Doodling over the video while the call is still in progress, applying or creating photo and video filters and discovering where your friends hang out are just a few among countless options Snapchat provides.
