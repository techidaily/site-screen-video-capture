## Beginner's Path to Filming with MacBook Webcam

In this article, I'll show you how to record your webcam on a Mac using various screen recorders. MacBook has been widely used for quite some time, and it has not only maintained its competitive edge over the years, but has also modernized and improved its services. Apple's operating system also has a built-in video recorder called as QuickTime player. It can also be used for capture and video recording, but it lacks the productivity and customization capabilities of the other tools in this article.
