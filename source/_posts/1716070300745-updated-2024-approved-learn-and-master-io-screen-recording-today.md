## The Bottom Line

Screen Recorder IO is a unique screen recorder that you do not have to download and install on your computer. You can simply open their official website and start recording your computer screen. The video quality is not super high, but it gets the job done. There are various standard features available, but even the premium plan has several limitations. It is available for free and therefore, you should give it a try. If you are not satisfied, you can opt for Wondershare Filmora for professional-quality screen recording.
