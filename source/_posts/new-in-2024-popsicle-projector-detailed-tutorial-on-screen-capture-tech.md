****Video quality**

This screen recorder supports a variety of video formats and can be used on almost all devices. Along with that, you will also be able to configure the quality, resolution, and framerate of the output video that you are going to record on your screen.

****Supported devices**

There are three versions of the Icecream screen recorder that are available on Windows, macOS, and Android devices.

So, regarding compatibility with any device, there are very less chances that you are going to have any complications with this application.

****Recording time length**

There are two formats in which the Icecream screen recorder is available to its users. For new users the free trial version is open and for users who want to take full benefits of its tools, they can go for the premium membership with a payment system.

For the free trial version, the maximum recording time length is 10 minutes and there are few recording tools available with it. But with the pro membership version, the users are allowed to record without any restrictions or time limits.
