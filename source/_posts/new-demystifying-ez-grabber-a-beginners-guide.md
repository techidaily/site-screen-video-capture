## Demystifying EZ Grabber: A Beginner's Guide

Are you a full-time gamer or like to rewatch some spectacular scenes from the movies or videos you see on your computer later? But are unable to record those moments separately and at that instant and later need to go back to that point of the scene to record the same. It might get a bit time-consuming and frustrating to do so. For this situation, the ideal problem solver would be installing the **EZ grabber software** on your computer.

The EZ grabber software is a piece of capturing equipment designed to capture MPEG that converts the images on screen into videos. You can easily record the videos on screen by clicking the rec button and connecting your device using an S-video connector or an AV. The resolution of the videos can touch the heights of 720p, which you can also edit and upload on the internet.
