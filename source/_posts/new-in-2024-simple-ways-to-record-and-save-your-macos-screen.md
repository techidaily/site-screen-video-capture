### Tip 4.Bonus Tip Wondershare Filmora for Mac

One all-in-one video capture & editing tool for Mac that is getting a lot of attention recently in Wondershare. Users are enthusiastic about this program's blend of advanced features and more versatile and professional performance.

Wondershare Filmora for Mac supports all formats (including .mov) shot on any digital camera, mobile phone, or camcorder. It also has an extensive list of advanced video editing and screen capture tools, including:

• Multiple export options, including burn-to-DVD  
• Text & titles editor  
• Advanced audio editing features
