There is no doubt that playing VR games is more fun on gaming consoles than on computers. When you are playing VR games with your VR headset, it feels more natural to play the game from a gaming console rather than playing from a keyboard. If you use PlayStation 4 as your VR console, you can use the built-in recording option on PS4 to record virtual reality gameplay. Here are the steps you need to follow minutely.

Step 5: Open your VR game and start playing it. Press Share button on PS4 twice to start recording in the background. The recording will go on as per the duration you set in Step 3.

## Way 5\. Use Nvidia to Record VR Games

If you have a gaming computer and you are using Nvidia graphic card, you can record VR games using VR game recorder ShadowPlay.

When you install graphic driver, Nvidia Geforce Experience gets automatically installed. You have to turn on ShadowPlay to capture VR gameplay. Here are the steps you have to follow minutely.
