### Recording Settings

The software does not force its users to stick with the default settings for recordings. Instead, it has given a free hand to customize the settings. You can define a 'Record Quality.' Users can also set a 'Record Time,' after which the recording will automatically stop. With Filmora Screen Recorder, you can set your desired 'Frame Rate.'

You can press F9 to stop the recording. The final media file will be shared with your Media Library. Now comes the fun part: you can edit the screen recordings with Filomra Video Editor. Users can add various effects and transitions to their recording to enhance its quality. With Wondershare Filmora Video Editor, you can also add text and titles to your video to add more clarity.
