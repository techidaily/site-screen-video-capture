## Conclusion

Open Broadcaster Program, also known as OBS, is a free open-source software for video recording and live broadcasting compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. It has multiple functions, including real-time video capture from different sources and devices, scene creation, coding, recording, and broadcasting. OBS does not give video editing tools that you may use in improving your movies. However, there is software that you can utilize. So, for that, we recommend going for any best alternative or we suggest Filmora as it has amazing features suitable for beginners and professionals.
