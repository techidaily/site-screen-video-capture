Those with a strong passion for PlayStation Portable games will want an emulator for iOS that is open-source. A unique collection of games and an exciting set of features made PS2Smart the best emulator on the market. This emulator tool is cross-platform compatible, so it will run smoothly once you download a game from it, no matter what platform you use. If you want to download a game, make sure your connection to the internet is strong.

**Key Features:**

## Conclusion

These are some of the best PSP consoles for iOS users. There is no doubt that PPSSPP is one of the first and one of the most user-friendly consoles. However, if you are encountering any issues with PPSSPP, you can go for other options that are also pretty good. Sometimes, user preferences also play an essential role here.
