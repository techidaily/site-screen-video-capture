## PS1 Classics on Your Desktop: The Best Emulators Reviewed

Sony released its first standalone console for video games, Playstation1 (nicknamed PS1), in 2001\.

Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.

You can play PlayStation games on your Android phone and PC using ePSXe (short for enhanced PSX emulator). A wide range of devices are supported, making it a fast, accurate, and highly versatile tool. Within seconds, you can start playing games after configuring the program. It is just a matter of copying the BIOS file from your console, setting up the controller, and customizing the keys.

Gameplay usually runs smoothly without much configuration and trial-and-error. When your game doesn't load or you experience lags, you can fix it by applying an ePSXe patch (in .ppf format).

**Features:**

* This software provides a close analogous experience to playing video games on the PlayStation One itself, but on a personal computer.
* Its controller options can be tailored to meet your needs.
* It allows you to pause, resume, and save your gameplay from the point you last left it.
* Dual-player and split-screen modes are available. Additionally, you can also use external gamepads to play your favorite video games.
