The recording option stays activated for seven days. Thereafter, you have to activate it again from General section.

Step 3: The recording will stop automatically as soon as you stop your live stream. If you want to stop recording in between, you have to disable the recording option and save VOD file. You can find the recorded video under “Video on Demand” option.

It is important to note that you can record Dacast live stream video only if you are the creator of the video. It is not possible for a viewer to record with Dacast and the viewer needs to use a dedicated screen recorder.

## Way 3\. Record with Restream

Restream is another popular live streaming platform and you can live stream your video on almost all the popular online live streaming websites. If you are using Restream to live stream video, you can record your video as well. First of all, Restream Studio automatically records your live stream videos as soon as you go live.

When your live stream gets over, you will get to download in your hard drive as well as export the recording to cloud storage platforms. Apart from that, there is a Record-only Mode that also lets you record your video on Restream. Here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Open Restream Studio.

Step 2: Click on Record Only option on the home screen.

## Way 5\. Use Screencastify

Screencastify is a Google Chrome extension and many users prefer it over an online tool. Even though it is free to use but the free version is limited to 5 minutes only. The premium version allows you to record any screen activity without any restriction. You can not only record live stream meeting as a viewer but also as a speaker. This is because you can record from webcam and external mic. There are also drawing tools available. Here are the steps to record from any live stream conference software and online platforms.

Step 1: Visit “www.screencastify.com/products/screen-recorder” and click on Add to Chrome button.
