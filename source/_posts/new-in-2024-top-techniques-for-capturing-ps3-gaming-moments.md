Step 2: Connect your PS3 to your TV and the USB cable from the capture card should go to your computer.

Step 3: Turn on PS3 and go to Settings to make sure PS3 software is updated so that there is no issue in connectivity with capture card and computer.

Step 4: On your computer, configure the capture card and you must be seeing the same gameplay that you are seeing on your TV. To record the gameplay, you can use any online screen recorder or the inbuilt screen recorder of your capture card.

## Way 3\. Record PS 3 with USB

Not many gamers are aware of the fact that they can record their gameplay with USB storage device when their gaming console has USB port. Specifically for PS3 users, you need to purchase a USB pen drive and format it in FAT32 from your computer. You will need Snagit 11 or 12 gameplay recorder to achieve your objective. Here are the simple steps to record PS3 gameplay easily.

Step 1: Download and install Snagit 11/12 on your computer.

Step 2: Connect your USB drive to your computer.

Step 3: Go to the drive where you have installed Snagit and go inside TechSmith folder.

Step 4: Copy Snagit from the folder to your USB drive.

Step 5: Now, unplug the USB drive from computer and plug it into your PS3.

Step 6: Start playing your game on PS3 and Snagit will start recording your gameplay in the background.

Step 7: When you are done playing, unplug the USB drive and connect it to your computer to get the recorded gameplay.

## Way 4\. Record PS3 with OBS Studio

If you are looking for a way on how to record ps3 gameplay for free, OBS Studio is your solution. OBS is a popular software in the gaming community through which most gamers live stream their gameplay on Twitch and YouTube. However, the OBS Studio is a great scree recorder and you can record PS3 gameplay easily. However, you will first need to stream your gameplay on your computer screen for OBS Studio to capture. You can use a capture card or a PS3 emulator to stream PS3 gameplay on computer screen. Here are the steps on how to record your gameplay on PS3 with OBS.

Step 1: Launch OBS on your computer. Go to Sources tab, click on “+” button. Select Game Capture from the menu.

## The Bottom Line

Even though PlayStation 3 is not the latest gaming console and there is no built-in screen recorder like PS4 and PS5, you can still record your gameplay and upload on social media and video streaming platforms. The best way is to buy a capture card and use Filmora to record PS3 gameplay flawlessly. You can edit the recorded video and make it more interesting to get positive feedback from online viewers.
