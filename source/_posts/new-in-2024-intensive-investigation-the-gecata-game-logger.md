## Part 2: How to Use Gecata to Record Games

Movavi Gecata is a relatively new continuing interaction recording program that costs just $19.95 and has all of the features that gamers want. PC games are more well-known than they have ever been, and players are eager to document their interactions.

The user interface is simple, yet it's functional and easy to navigate. You may record any game in 4K ultra-HD resolution, whether it's a 2D or 3D game. It also has editing capabilities, making it one of the most popular games recording programs available.

We recommend [Filmora video recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as one choice. Whatever you want to record, whether it's gaming, web player videos, continuing commentary, music, or anything else.
