You can both enable the screen recording shortcut in the notification panel, and press the volume up button and the Power button at the same time. Besides, you can record your Huawei screen with knuckling gestures. Let’s check the detailed screen recording steps.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Screen-Recorder-Shortcut-Switch-to-Record-Huawei-Screen"><a href="#1-Using-Screen-Recorder-Shortcut-Switch-to-Record-Huawei-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Screen Recorder Shortcut Switch to Record Huawei Screen"></a>1. Using Screen Recorder Shortcut Switch to Record Huawei Screen</h4><p>Pull-down notification panel from the top, find the Screen Recorder shortcut icon, and tap it to enable the screen recording feature. A notification will appear on your screen asking you if you want to enable the phone’s screencasting feature. Read the notification and instructions carefully and tap Agree to start the screen recording. To stop recording, just go to the notification panel again, and tap the screen recorder icon again and the screen recording will be stopped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/huawei-screen-recorder-shortcut.jpg"                      alt="Huawei Smartphone screen recorder"                ></p><h4 id="2-Pressing-Buttons-to-Record-Huawei-Screen"><a href="#2-Pressing-Buttons-to-Record-Huawei-Screen" class="headerlink" title="2. Pressing Buttons to Record Huawei Screen"></a>2. Pressing Buttons to Record Huawei Screen</h4><p>Besides enabling the screen recording feature from the shortcut menu, you can also use buttons to capture your screen on Huawei smartphone quickly. Just hold the Volume Up and Power buttons that are located on the right side of your device to activate the screen recording feature.</p><p>Hit the Enable button on the popup window which asking your permission to microphone and storage, and then a new notification will emerge informing you that sound will be recorded as well or that the screen capturing session will stop if you have an incoming call. Simply tap Next and when the new screen appears and tap on Done to start the countdown before the screen recording session.</p><p>After the screen recording begins, you will see a red button at the top left corner on your Huawei phone. To stop the recording, you can tap the Stop button or press the Volume up and Power buttons simultaneously again.</p><h4 id="3-Using-Knuckle-gestures-to-record-your-Huawei-screen"><a href="#3-Using-Knuckle-gestures-to-record-your-Huawei-screen" class="headerlink" title="3. Using Knuckle gestures to record your Huawei screen"></a>3. Using Knuckle gestures to record your Huawei screen</h4><p>Huawei P10&#x2F;P20&#x2F;Mate 10 allows you to record the phone screen activities with the knuckle gestures due to the Knuckle Sense technology.</p><p>Before using the double knuckles to record the screen activities, you need to enable the <strong>Smart screenshot&#x2F;screen recording</strong> feature first. Find and tap the <strong>Motion Control</strong> option in <strong>Settings</strong>, and then turn on the Smart screenshot&#x2F;screen recording under <strong>Knuckle gesture</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hauwei-record-screen-knuckle-gesture-setting.jpg"                      alt="Huawei Smartphone screen recorder"                ></p><p>If you want to record the screen video, just knock the screen with two knuckles twice continuously when your Huawei phone is not sleeping. Read the information on the popped up window and tap <strong>Agree</strong> to start the screen recording. You can stop the screen recording by knocking the screen twice with two knuckles again.</p><p>The maximum duration of the screen recording you can make can’t exceed the five-minute limit. If you would like to capture longer videos of your screen, you can do so by using free third-party <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording apps for Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, such as AZ Recorder. But if you are using the built-in screen recording feature on Huawei smartphone, the recording function of the third-party apps will be disabled.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Find-the-Recorded-Videos"><a href="#Where-to-Find-the-Recorded-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Where to Find the Recorded Videos"></a>Where to Find the Recorded Videos</h2><p>All screen recordings you create will be displayed in the phone’s <strong>Gallery</strong> app. Locate the Screenshots or Screen Recordings folder on the Albums tab and then tap on the Share icon if you would like to post the recording on social media or send it to a friend. Hit the Delete button to remove the recording from your phone. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete either of these two processes.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Capturing your phone’s screen can help you entertain your friends and followers on social media or to share valuable information with your business associates. Huawei’s Smartphones enable you to accomplish both of these tasks in just a few simple steps.

Using Knuckle gestures to record your Huawei screen</h4><p>Huawei P10&#x2F;P20&#x2F;Mate 10 allows you to record the phone screen activities with the knuckle gestures due to the Knuckle Sense technology.</p><p>Before using the double knuckles to record the screen activities, you need to enable the <strong>Smart screenshot&#x2F;screen recording</strong> feature first. Find and tap the <strong>Motion Control</strong> option in <strong>Settings</strong>, and then turn on the Smart screenshot&#x2F;screen recording under <strong>Knuckle gesture</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hauwei-record-screen-knuckle-gesture-setting.jpg"                      alt="Huawei Smartphone screen recorder"                ></p><p>If you want to record the screen video, just knock the screen with two knuckles twice continuously when your Huawei phone is not sleeping.

But if you are using the built-in screen recording feature on Huawei smartphone, the recording function of the third-party apps will be disabled.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Find-the-Recorded-Videos-3"><a href="#Where-to-Find-the-Recorded-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Where to Find the Recorded Videos"></a>Where to Find the Recorded Videos</h2><p>All screen recordings you create will be displayed in the phone’s <strong>Gallery</strong> app. Locate the Screenshots or Screen Recordings folder on the Albums tab and then tap on the Share icon if you would like to post the recording on social media or send it to a friend. Hit the Delete button to remove the recording from your phone. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete either of these two processes.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Capturing your phone’s screen can help you entertain your friends and followers on social media or to share valuable information with your business associates. Huawei’s Smartphones enable you to accomplish both of these tasks in just a few simple steps. However, the built-in Screen Recorder on Huawei’s Mate 10, 20 P20 or P10 Android devices doesn’t allow you to specify the region of the screen you want to capture or select the frame rate, so if you want to gain access to more powerful screen recording tools you should install an app such as AZ Screen Recorder or DU Recorder from the Google Play Store, but you can also record the screen on the computer with some desktop screen recorders.

Mirror Effect"></a>1. Mirror Effect</h4><p>The mirror effect enables by default and lets you flip the video display during the conference. To enable or disable this feature, click the <strong>Settings</strong> icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window (when not in a conference), select Video from the left pane, and check or uncheck the Mirror my video box from the right, respectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-mirror-my-video.jpg"                      alt="zoom meeting mirror video"                ></p><h4 id="2-Appearance-Touchup-2"><a href="#2-Appearance-Touchup-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Appearance Touchup"></a>2. Appearance Touchup</h4><p>This feature makes your camera visuals less crispy. It’s a great effect to distract other meeting participants with the imperfections your sleepy face or clothes have when you’re right out of bed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-touch-my-appearance.jpg"                      alt="zoom meeting touch appearance"                ></p><h4 id="3-Virtual-Backgrounds-2"><a href="#3-Virtual-Backgrounds-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Virtual Backgrounds"></a>3. Virtual Backgrounds</h4><p>Virtual backgrounds let you hide those wrinkled or untidy bedsheets or wet towels that are generally hovering around your messy home. When enabled, you can choose a pleasant environment or other scenic beauty visible to other participants during the session.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-change-virtual-background.jpg"                      alt="change virtual background"                ></p><h4 id="4-Prevent-Screen-Sharing-2"><a href="#4-Prevent-Screen-Sharing-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Prevent Screen Sharing"></a>4.Prevent Screen Sharing</h4><p>You can keep all the ignorant participants from sharing their screens accidentally while you’re discussing a serious matter. For this purpose, hit the up-facing arrow beside <strong>the Share</strong> <strong>Screen</strong> option from the bottom of the camera window, click <strong>Advanced Sharing</strong> <strong>Options</strong>, and choose the <strong>Only Host</strong> radio button from the <strong>Who can share section</strong> that appears on the following box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-only-host-sharing-screen.jpg"                      alt="zoom meeting sharing screen"                ></p><h4 id="5-Mute-Participants-2"><a href="#5-Mute-Participants-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Mute Participants"></a>5. Mute Participants</h4><p>You can mute all the participants in one go and remove unnecessary voices appearing like a fish market. To do this, select <strong>the Manage Participants</strong> option from the bottom of the camera screen and then hit the <strong>Mute All</strong> button from the <strong>Participants</strong> pane’s bottom left corner.</p><p>You can also select the <strong>Mute</strong> button next to each participant’s name in the Participants pane to mute them individually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-mute-people.jpg"                      alt="zoom meeting mute"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The process of applying Zoom video filters is simple, and learning how to set up a third-party camera for Snapchat filters for Zoom is even simpler. For the latter, however, you are required to install an add-in that is freely available from the vendor’s official website. To conclude, being one of the most straightforward solutions (i.e., free in most scenarios) for video conferences and virtual business meetings, almost all the corporate professionals around the globe prefer Zoom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-3"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-3" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>The Zoom video meeting and chat app has become a wildly famous hostage to billions of folks studying, working, and socializing from home. Despite several security concerns that arose alongside Zoom’s social platform, it now features end-to-end encryption and other ways to protect your privacy. In addition, it has also resolved chats from “Zoombombing” and other privacy flaws. All in all, Zoom is adding new features daily as per the people’s concerns, and the introduction of <strong>Zoom video filters</strong> is among them.</p><p>The <strong>Zoom meeting filters</strong> help make your video meetings experience a little less weird – and hopefully avoid Zoom anxiety and Zoom fatigue.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Use Native and Third-Party Zoom Filters?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Use Zoom Video Filters: A Step-by-Step Guide [Desktop, Android, iOS]</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to use Snapchat Filters on Zoom?

Mirror Effect"></a>1. Mirror Effect</h4><p>The mirror effect enables by default and lets you flip the video display during the conference. To enable or disable this feature, click the <strong>Settings</strong> icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window (when not in a conference), select Video from the left pane, and check or uncheck the Mirror my video box from the right, respectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-mirror-my-video.jpg"                      alt="zoom meeting mirror video"                ></p><h4 id="2-Appearance-Touchup-3"><a href="#2-Appearance-Touchup-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Appearance Touchup"></a>2. Appearance Touchup</h4><p>This feature makes your camera visuals less crispy. It’s a great effect to distract other meeting participants with the imperfections your sleepy face or clothes have when you’re right out of bed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-touch-my-appearance.jpg"                      alt="zoom meeting touch appearance"                ></p><h4 id="3-Virtual-Backgrounds-3"><a href="#3-Virtual-Backgrounds-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Virtual Backgrounds"></a>3. Virtual Backgrounds</h4><p>Virtual backgrounds let you hide those wrinkled or untidy bedsheets or wet towels that are generally hovering around your messy home. When enabled, you can choose a pleasant environment or other scenic beauty visible to other participants during the session.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-change-virtual-background.jpg"                      alt="change virtual background"                ></p><h4 id="4-Prevent-Screen-Sharing-3"><a href="#4-Prevent-Screen-Sharing-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Prevent Screen Sharing"></a>4.Prevent Screen Sharing</h4><p>You can keep all the ignorant participants from sharing their screens accidentally while you’re discussing a serious matter. For this purpose, hit the up-facing arrow beside <strong>the Share</strong> <strong>Screen</strong> option from the bottom of the camera window, click <strong>Advanced Sharing</strong> <strong>Options</strong>, and choose the <strong>Only Host</strong> radio button from the <strong>Who can share section</strong> that appears on the following box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-only-host-sharing-screen.jpg"                      alt="zoom meeting sharing screen"                ></p><h4 id="5-Mute-Participants-3"><a href="#5-Mute-Participants-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Mute Participants"></a>5. Mute Participants</h4><p>You can mute all the participants in one go and remove unnecessary voices appearing like a fish market. To do this, select <strong>the Manage Participants</strong> option from the bottom of the camera screen and then hit the <strong>Mute All</strong> button from the <strong>Participants</strong> pane’s bottom left corner.</p><p>You can also select the <strong>Mute</strong> button next to each participant’s name in the Participants pane to mute them individually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-mute-people.jpg"                      alt="zoom meeting mute"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The process of applying Zoom video filters is simple, and learning how to set up a third-party camera for Snapchat filters for Zoom is even simpler. For the latter, however, you are required to install an add-in that is freely available from the vendor’s official website. To conclude, being one of the most straightforward solutions (i.e., free in most scenarios) for video conferences and virtual business meetings, almost all the corporate professionals around the globe prefer Zoom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

As soon as the Game Bar is open on your screen, hit the camera shaped button available on the bar; it is named “Screenshot.”</p><p>In case if you find it little difficult to open your game bar using these keys in between a game; Windows 10 also allows users to customize these keys as per their convenience.

Taking Game Screenshots with Game Bar on Windows 10"></a>1. Taking Game Screenshots with Game Bar on Windows 10</h4><p>If you are not interested in installing any additional tool on your gaming PC, it is even possible to capture high-quality game screenshots using Game Bar. While playing an adventure game, you first need to open the game bar; but it is easy to do with keyboard-based shortcuts. Simply press, Windows + Alt + Print Screen or it can also be done by hitting Windows + G keys.

In most of the games, the screenshot can be captured instantly using “Print Screen” key; however, few games may follow other settings for screen capture.

For example, in all Blizzard’s Battle.net games, the Print Screen key always helps to capture a screenshot, and they can be later found in a hard drive-based folder. However, the folder name can be different for every game; for example, if you capture a screenshot while playing Overwatch, it will be saved at folder location: Documents\Overwatch\Screenshots\Overwatch. You can perform a web search to know the suitable screenshot key for every game. This information can also be obtained from the shortcut configuration menu.</p><h4 id="3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut-3"><a href="#3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

This is because if they allow screen record, the recordings will get distributed across the world for free. Spotify holds the license for distribution and free distribute will hurt the business. Therefore, Spotify offers no option for screen recording. However, premium Spotify users can download any track and listen offline only through Spotify.</p><p> <strong>How do I record a stream on Spotify?</strong></p><p>The only way to record a stream on Spotify is by using a Spotify recorder.

Related FAQs</h2><p><strong>Does Spotify let you screen record?</strong></p><p>No, Spotify does not let you screen record. This is because if they allow screen record, the recordings will get distributed across the world for free. Spotify holds the license for distribution and free distribute will hurt the business. Therefore, Spotify offers no option for screen recording. However, premium Spotify users can download any track and listen offline only through Spotify.</p><p> <strong>How do I record a stream on Spotify?</strong></p><p>The only way to record a stream on Spotify is by using a Spotify recorder. If you are using Spotify on your smartphone, you will need Spotify recorder Android and iOS, respectively. If you are using Spotify on your computer, you will need Spotify recorder Windows and Mac, respectively. Once you have installed Spotify audio recorder, you need to get the settings perfect on the application and hit the Record button. Start the track that you want to record, and once the recording is over, hit the Stop button.<br>The Bottom Line</p><p>There is no option available to record a stream on Spotify. If you are a premium Spotify user, you can download them to listen to them offline. However, the downloaded files are protected in such a way that you can play them through Spotify only. Therefore, if you are a free user and you want to record any track, you need an audio recorder for Spotify. Among free ones, Free Sound Recorder is the best. But for premium quality recording, we recommend Wondershare Filmora that comes with a plethora of features and functionalities.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="High-Quality-Videos-at-Your-Fingertesps-Selecting-the-Right-FPS"><a href="#High-Quality-Videos-at-Your-Fingertesps-Selecting-the-Right-FPS" class="headerlink" title="High-Quality Videos at Your Fingertesps: Selecting the Right FPS"></a>High-Quality Videos at Your Fingertesps: Selecting the Right FPS</h2><p>You probably didn’t anticipate coming across so many technical terms when you first started recording videos. You only wanted to make quality content you know your audience will enjoy. Now you are hearing phrases like frame rate being tossed around, leaving you a bit intimidated.</p><p>After all, you want your videos to be the best they can ever be, don’t you? Plenty of thought and consideration goes into making a high-quality video for YouTube or any other social media platform where your audience will watch it. Therefore, educating yourself and applying the knowledge accordingly would be wise.</p><p>Keep reading this article to learn more about FPS in video recording and how to choose the best frame rate.</p><h2 id="Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording"><a href="#Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Overview of FPS in Video Recording"></a>Overview of FPS in Video Recording</h2><p>A video works very similarly to a flipbook, which contains a series of still images. When you view these images at a certain speed, the animation unfolds, giving the illusion that the images are moving. Each image is known as a frame, and the frame rate is the speed at which the frames move. Frame rate is usually expressed as “frames per second,” or FPS in short.</p><p>If a video is set to play at 24fps, it means there are 24 frames in every second the video plays. Technology is very nifty and can trick your brain into the idea that animation flows smoothly. However, if the video were slowed down, you would notice that the motion is not as smooth as it seems. This smooth motion enables you to enjoy the video without hiccups or disruptions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-recording-fps.jpg"                      alt="fps in video recording"                ></p><p>In addition to influencing your audience’s viewing experience, the frame rate also affects how realistic you want your video to be. An FPS of 24 is ideal for movies because the motion is similar to how we see the world.</p><p>On the other hand, sporting events and video games require a higher frame rate to accommodate all the events happening simultaneously. The high frame rate also keeps the details crisp and ensures the motion is as smooth as possible. You wouldn’t want to watch a football match where the motion cuts every three minutes.</p><p>A lower FPS is ideal if you want to blur the video or use techniques like slow motion in the video. You could also opt for a lower FPS if you’re creating animated GIFs. Remember, you can’t make your GIF too large. Therefore, you would rather sacrifice detail and fluid motion and choose a low frame rate with a smaller size.</p><h2 id="What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?"></a>What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a rule set in stone that will guide you in choosing a frame rate. In fact, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding which frame rate will give your audience the best viewing experience. Research won’t yield the answers you are looking for since there are points to support just about any frame rate you google.</p><p>The simple fact is that different FPS will yield different results, meaning there is no perfect frame rate. The option you choose for your videos will depend on your unique needs and the type of content you want to create. However, there are a few factors you need to consider before you pick the best fps to record video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-recording-video-fps.jpg"                      alt="factors for choosing fps in video recording"                ></p><h4 id="Motion"><a href="#Motion" class="headerlink" title="Motion"></a>Motion</h4><p>If your video contains a lot of movement, it would be wise to stick to a higher frame rate to keep the motion crisp. We also urge you to capture the video at a higher frame rate for increased editing flexibility.</p><h4 id="Realism"><a href="#Realism" class="headerlink" title="Realism"></a>Realism</h4><p>Even though movies are fictitious, the concept should be tied to how we naturally see the world. For instance, when a person throws a ball, we see a bit of blur as the object moves in the air. Therefore, the frame rate you choose should mimic this motion blur and make your video more realistic.</p><h4 id="Delivery"><a href="#Delivery" class="headerlink" title="Delivery"></a>Delivery</h4><p>You can be lax about the frame rate if you want to deliver the video on the Internet because the viewers are a bit forgiving. However, we urge you to stick to 24fps if you project a movie in the theatre to give it a cinematic look. On the other hand, the best frame rate for recording video for TV would be between 24 to 30fps.</p><h3 id="File-size-and-export-time"><a href="#File-size-and-export-time" class="headerlink" title="File size and export time"></a>File size and export time</h3><p>Last but not least, it would be wise to consider the ideal file size for your video and how long it will take to export it. A higher frame rate means more still images are packed into one second of the video. The file size automatically increases, and you will notice that it takes longer to export your videos to platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.</p><h2 id="30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better"><a href="#30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better" class="headerlink" title="30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?"></a>30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?</h2><p>By now, you understand that 30fps means that 30 still images are packed into one second of the video. The same principle applies to 60fps. You will see 30 fps in soap operas, television, and live broadcasts. The shots in this frame rate are more detailed, even though they give the video an unrealistic feel because that isn’t how we naturally view the world.</p><p>On the other hand, 60fps is commonly used in fast-paced videos where you need enough frames to accommodate the action and enjoy the video. However, more filmmakers and directors are incorporating 60 fps in their videos to make the motion look smooth. Have you ever wondered how a slow-motion scene looks so crisp even when the camera zooms in on the actor? A 60-fps frame rate is the answer!</p><p>The debate still continues and people continue to compare 30 vs 60 fps video recording. As we mentioned earlier, there is no ideal fps recording. It all depends on what you want to do with your video.</p><p>For instance, if you want a slow-motion scene with little to no motion blur, then you are better off choosing 60 FPS. You could also choose a higher frame rate when shooting at concerts where a lot is happening at once.</p><p>However, smoothness is not always the best. You are better off sticking to realistic shots for movies or TV shows because that is what day-to-day life looks like. Therefore, 30 FPS is the best choice. An even lower frame rate would work if you want your movie to have a jittery feel or you want to insert a comedic feel into your content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/30-60-fps-video-recording.jpg"                      alt="30 vs 60 fps video recording"                ></p><h2 id="Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording"><a href="#Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?"></a>Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?</h2><p>It wouldn’t be a great idea to jump into choosing a high frame rate for your video without understanding what it means or how it will affect the viewing experience.</p><p>Remember, a higher frame rate is not always the best fps for recording video. It might also do more harm than good and leave your video in shambles. You wouldn’t want to go back to the drawing board because you jumped on the bandwagon of choosing a high fps for the sake of it.</p><p>We urge you to do your homework and find out which frame rate works best for the content you want to create. A high fps recording also means your file will be bigger and take longer than usual to export.</p><p>A higher FPS isn’t the ideal choice if you are not willing to deal with a large file size. Another crucial factor to consider would be the viewing experience for your audience.</p><h2 id="How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS"><a href="#How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS" class="headerlink" title="How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?"></a>How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?</h2><p>Developers have been working tirelessly to create apps to help content creators and filmmakers like yourself record and edit their videos. There is no shortage of screen recording tools online to help you get your videos to the ideal frame rate.</p><p>We understand if you feel lost and wonder which tool best suits your needs. In our opinion, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best editing tools you could have in your arsenal. The Screen Recorder feature on this platform is exquisite, allowing you to record anything you do on your screen effortlessly.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Wondershare Filmora also supports screen + webcam recording since the developers understand that videos with a speaker are more engaging than if you only recorded a voiceover. As you play a game, review a product, host an online meeting or record a tutorial, you can record video and audio of yourself using the webcam.</p><p>Another exciting perk of using this screen recorder feature is that you don’t need to display your entire screen. You can customize your recording area and set the platform to capture a target window within specific dimensions.</p><p>Below is a detailed guide on how to use Wondershare Filmora to record your screen.</p><p>Step 1 Go to the homepage on the browser and install the desktop app on your device. Once the installation is complete, click “File” and then select “Record Media” on the drop-down menu. You can then choose whether to record a voiceover, record your PC screen, or from your webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen-2.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora record media"                ></p><p>Step 2 Customize your screen recording using the tools in the platform. For instance, you could customize the width and height of the screen, choose the ideal frame rate, set a countdown timer, and choose how you want your mouse to appear on the screen as you click.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Tutorial/record-desktop-screen-2.JPG"                      alt="wondershare filmora screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 3 After you are satisfied with the changes in the step above, click on the red record button to begin recording your screen. However, you must manually click the “Stop” button to end the recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-google-meet-with-filmora.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora prepare record"                ></p><p>Step 4 Click “Export” to save a copy of the video to your device. You can also share the video directly on YouTube or any other social media platform.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As a content creator, you now understand how important frame rates are and how crucial it is to choose the best one for your video. With enough practice, you will get the hang of it and have no issues choosing the best frame rate for any video you want to record.

You can customize your recording area and set the platform to capture a target window within specific dimensions.</p><p>Below is a detailed guide on how to use Wondershare Filmora to record your screen.</p><p>Step 1 Go to the homepage on the browser and install the desktop app on your device. Once the installation is complete, click “File” and then select “Record Media” on the drop-down menu. You can then choose whether to record a voiceover, record your PC screen, or from your webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen-2.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora record media"                ></p><p>Step 2 Customize your screen recording using the tools in the platform. For instance, you could customize the width and height of the screen, choose the ideal frame rate, set a countdown timer, and choose how you want your mouse to appear on the screen as you click.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Tutorial/record-desktop-screen-2.JPG"                      alt="wondershare filmora screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 3 After you are satisfied with the changes in the step above, click on the red record button to begin recording your screen.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Getting-Started-with-OBS-on-Apple-A-Comprehensive-Guide"><a href="#Getting-Started-with-OBS-on-Apple-A-Comprehensive-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started with OBS on Apple: A Comprehensive Guide"></a>Getting Started with OBS on Apple: A Comprehensive Guide</h2><p>OBS Studio has evolved into one of the most powerful audio recording software on the market today. Using OBS game capture, you may record screen games for YouTube videos or share snippets of gameplay with your friends for free. With this article, we’ll cover how to record in OBS and how much storage space you’ll need for your recordings. With OBS, it’s easy to keep track of high scores, great in-game performances, and even tips on how to play like a pro quickly and effectively. Since gamers may use several third-party screen-recording techniques when recording their games, learning how to record gameplay using OBS is an ideal solution. An open-source tool called OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) will be utilized in this lesson.</p><p>It is widely utilized by both large and small broadcasters throughout the world because of its reliability as a streaming solution. Despite this, it’s an effective tool for capturing images. OBS Studio enables you to record video directly to your device instead of broadcasting your screen. The days of framed screenshots and complex settings are over. Video game streamers and teachers with a lot of video presentations are likely to be acquainted with the OBS Studio. However, due to the complex user interface, it’s a little tough for beginners to utilize. The good news is that there are a variety of OBS options to pick from. When it comes to performance, it’s on par with other, more costly options. For the most part, the program allows for live streaming to several sites, such as Facebook Live and Hitbox.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install OBS on Mac"></a>1. Download and Install OBS on Mac</h2><p>OBS is an open-source screen recorder and live streamer that is free to use. It’s now available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It’s a popular choice among more seasoned customers because of the large variety of options available in the product.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to the OBS Website</strong></p><p>Go to the OBS download page using your choice browser and save the installation file to your computer’s hard drive.<br>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/download" >OBS Website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 2: Get the Most Recent Version of the Software</strong></p><p>You may get the most recent version of OBS for Mac by clicking the button on the OBS website.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Download and Install the Software for Mac</strong></p><p>Open the package after downloading it. Drag the OBS icon to the Applications folder when the installer has been opened.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-and-install.jpg"                      alt="download video from funimate"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Get Started!</strong></p><p>Open OBS for the first time by going to the Applications folder and double-clicking on it. Selected ‘Continue’ will bring up a Welcome Screen for the Installer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-started.jpg"                      alt="get-started"                ></p><h2 id="2-Best-OBS-Settings-for-Mac"><a href="#2-Best-OBS-Settings-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="2. Best OBS Settings for Mac"></a>2. Best OBS Settings for Mac</h2><p>OBS Studio is a complex software that comes with pre-installed screencasting capabilities. Free software often lacks the breadth of features required for flawless broadcasting, but not with OSB Studio. Even though the program is free, it features all of the crucial components that characterize online broadcasting. Many additional parts and modules will be given by the software now and then. That suggests it’s really necessary to dabble and refresh with it. Else, you can experience a few hassles in using OBS correctly.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch and Create Output Recorder Setup</strong></p><p>Add on the Plus symbol and create the project. If you want to activate audio monitoring in OBS Studio: Right-click in the Output box, Open the Output mode or you can also go for Advanced Audio Properties:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-recorder-setup.jpg"                      alt="output recorder setup"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Customize Record Only Feature</strong></p><p>In OBS for Mac, this setting will deliver the sound of the source to the Desktop as it were. Work area sound should be enabled for the sound to be captured. As soon as you activate this option, navigate towards the recording interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record.jpg"                      alt="customize record"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Set the Screen and Output Mode</strong></p><p>In OBS Studio for Mac, this setting will broadcast the sound of the source to the stream and Desktop sound separately. This takes into mind individual sound control. To do so, go to the bottom right corner of your screen and pick “settings.” Then, under “recording path,” select the “output” option to specify the spot on your computer where you desire to keep the recordings. Right after that, press the Record button to start recording your Game Audio in parallel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-mode.jpg"                      alt="output mode"                ></p><h2 id="3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Record Screen with OBS on Mac"></a>3. How to Record Screen with OBS on Mac</h2><p>OBS Studio is open-source, free software that is worth a try for all users. This strategy may be used to solve the problem if you have two graphics cards, one of which is NVIDIA. The OBS black screen is most likely caused by OBS and the game you desire to record running on different graphics cards in this situation. The image of the game can’t be acquired as they’re on separate adapters, and it’s not available on the device OBS is utilizing.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install and Launch OBS</strong></p><p>To purchase OBS Studio, go to the OBS Project’s official website and join up for their download portal. OBS is available for download and installation. After that, determine whether you want to use Windows, macOS, or Linux. Click the “Windows” download option on the left to acquire OBS for Windows. After clicking it, the download for OBS Studio will begin and the user will be able to locate it on their computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-and-launch.jpg"                      alt="install and launch"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Scenes for Recording</strong></p><p>OBS Studio will be available on their PC when the installation is complete, and players may use it to record their Valorous games. The software, on the other hand, does not come pre-configured for recording and must be set up manually. Scenes should be added. Open OBS and go to the bottom left of the screen to the “+” icon below “scenes.” Add a “recording” scenario to the mix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-scenes.jpg"                      alt="add scenes"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Customize the Recording</strong></p><p>Users should go to the Output tab and set the Video Bitrate to 6000 Kbps, Encoder to Hardware, and Audio Bitrate to 256 after entering the settings. Users may also adjust the location of their recording by choosing the save path location in the same settings tab., in the “recording” scene, click the “+” sign below “sources” on the bottom left of the screen, and add a “display capture.” If you have more than one monitor, specify which one you wish to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-tab.jpg"                      alt="output tab"                ></p><p>You may add a “Video Capture Device” to capture your webcam and an “Audio Input Capture” to gather the sounds from your microphone if you wish to. The next step is for users to go to the Audio tab and deactivate Desktop Audio. Users may add an audio input device, such as a microphone, by setting the Mic&#x2F;Auxiliary device under the same tab.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Setup the Recording</strong></p><p>Now, in the bottom left corner of the screen, click the “Scene” button, and then tap the Add icon next to the scene tab under the sources tab. A drop-down menu will display after selecting the add button, enabling you to add Game Capture and Audio Output Capture. Two more tabs will appear under the sources tab, which must be set. Choose a shooting location as well as a video type. Finally, pick “recording format” and “mp4” (or any other file type) from the drop-down menu. In the “Best Parameters for OBS Recordings,” we’ll go over various additional variables that need to be modified to ensure high-quality outputs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p><p>Users may start recording their gameplay by hitting the “Start Recording” button on the bottom-right of OBS Studio when everything is set up. To stop recording, simply press the Stop Recording button, and the video will be saved at the previously set location. Now is the moment to hit the “start recording” button.</p><h2 id="4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-on-Mac"><a href="#4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="4. Alternative Way to Record Screen on Mac"></a>4. Alternative Way to Record Screen on Mac</h2><p>Filmora is an easy-to-use and free OBS alternative with a basic user interface. This program, like OBS, allows you to capture your screen in several ways, including full screen, half of the screen, and so on. It’s also an excellent audio recorder that enables you to capture system sound or microphones with a few simple clicks. Filmora contains a trimmer, which means you can easily alter your recorded files within this screen recording software, which is better than OBS. The recording option is a terrific method to capture games, a camera feed, or a display capture and keep it on your local device for sharing or editing later. You may use it to record any section of your screen and add narration from your microphone as well as video from your camera. You may add text, shapes, and photos to your video while it’s being filmed. Furthermore, this program allows you to simply construct interesting animations and flawless transitions.

However, did you know that to use the features of Google Meet, you must create or schedule a meeting beforehand? This not only makes the entire online video conferencing process more organized, but it streamlines it as well! This way users can create a session link for their team and share it with them manually and by inviting other users to the event.</p><p>Many wonder <strong>how to create Google Meet links</strong>, but have no fear! We are here to help you create and <strong>schedule Google Meet</strong> sessions.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1"> Creating a Google Meet on Laptop?

Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail"></a>1. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail</h3><p>Scheduling a session through Gmail is fairly simple, for this all the user requires is access to a Gmail account and they are good to go. First what one must do is sign into their Gmail account and go to the homepage.</p><p>On the left side of their screen, they will see options under the “Meet” heading, one is “New Meeting” and the other is “Join a Meeting”. If you are looking to create a new meeting then click on the “New Meeting” option.</p><p>Once that option is clicked, the user will be redirected to a new page that contains a meeting link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gmail-google-meet-invitation-link.jpg"                      alt=" google meet invitation link on Gmail"                ></p><p>Over here there are three options. By clicking the “copy link” button, individuals can copy and share the link with people they would like to invite to the meeting.</p><p>If they want to directly share the link, they can also click the “Send Invite” button and copy the meeting invite from there as well as share via email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-meet-invite-link-gmail.jpg"                      alt="share google meet invitation link on Gmail"                ></p><p>Upon clicking the “Share Via Email” option, users will be redirected to a new tab where they can see an email pop up and from there, they can invite participants to the session through their email address, as indicated in the image below.</p><p>If individuals want to instantly create and start the session, they can click the “Start Now” option, and the meeting will automatically start.</p><h3 id="2-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Calendar"><a href="#2-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Calendar" class="headerlink" title="2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar"></a>2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar</h3><p>Another way to create a Google Meet session is through the Google Calendar. Much like the process of creating it through Gmail, there are a few steps involved, but the process is very easy.</p><p>First individuals must go to the Google Calendar homepage and click the “Create” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-session-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="create google meet  on google calendar"                ></p><p>After clicking the create option, the screen will show two options; “ Event” and “Task”. Click the event option and a pop-up form will show up on the window which must be filled to create a Google Meet event.</p><p>Fill in the form, if you would like to invite participants to the Google Meet conference, you can also list down their email address in the “Add Guests” section. Once you have done that click the “Add Google Meet Video Conferencing” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-google-meet-video-conferencing-calendar.jpg"                      alt="add google meet  on google calendar"                ></p><p>An event link will appear in the form, along with a button that says “Join With Google Meet”. Once you are done filling in the form, click “Save”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-via-google-calendar-link.jpg"                      alt="join google meet  via  google calendar link"                ></p><p>If you are looking to join the conference instantly, click the “Join With Google Meet” option and you will be redirected to the conference. If you would like to join later, you can copy the joining link and search it on the Google search bar to be redirected to the conference.</p><h3 id="3-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Meet"><a href="#3-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="3. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Meet"></a>3. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Meet</h3><p>Did you know you can directly create a conference through the Google Meet homepage as well? All you have to do is go to the Google Meet homepage and click the “New Meeting” button.</p><p>Upon clicking the button, you will see three options. From that click the “Start an Instant Meeting” option and you will be redirected to a new conference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-schedule-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Create schedule google meet"                ></p><p>These are the three highly recommended ways to create a Google Meet session instantly, but remember, to make use of any of these options, you must have a Gmail account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-on-Android-iPhone-iPad"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-on-Android-iPhone-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create Google Meet on Android&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Part 2: How to Create Google Meet on Android&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Google Meet comes with an option for groups to create video conferences on their mobile and tablet devices as well. Whether you are using an Android device or iOS, you can easily create a meeting!</p><p>One thing to remember is that in order to create Google Meet sessions through a mobile or tablet device is that one must download the application of Google Meet.</p><p>Once the application has been downloaded into your device, open the Google Meet app to its homepage and two options will appear in front of you: “New Meeting ‘’ and “Join With a Code’’. To create Google Meet sessions, click the “New Meeting’’ option.</p><p>Upon clicking that button, three new options will appear:</p><ul><li>Get a meeting link to share - use this when you would like to create a meeting link and share it with other invitees and start the meeting after some time</li><li>Start an instant meeting - make use of this option if you would like to automatically join the meeting and then share the link with participants later on</li><li>Schedule in Google Calendar - use this option when you would like to create a meeting for the future. If you would like to know more about this, keep on reading as it will be covered later in this article.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-schedule-google-meet-iphone-android.jpg"                      alt="Create schedule google meet on iphone and android phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Schedule-and-Create-Google-Meet-Link-For-The-Future"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Schedule-and-Create-Google-Meet-Link-For-The-Future" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Schedule and Create Google Meet Link For The Future?"></a>Part 3: How to Schedule and Create Google Meet Link For The Future?</h2><p>There are times when individuals feel far more comfortable and organized knowing that they have pre-scheduled their meeting for the week. The best way to schedule and create Google Meet links for the future is through Google Calendar.</p><p>One must first redirect themselves to the Google Calendar homepage and click the create option in the top left corner of their screen.</p><p>They must then select “Event” and proceed from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-calendar-google-meet-event.jpg"                      alt="Create  google meet on Google Calendar"                ></p><p>A pop-up form will appear on the screen which requires information regarding the conference. If you are looking to create an event for the future, first give it a title in the title section. Then move on to the date and time section and set the date to a time in the future for when you require the session to take place.</p><p>You can change the date by clicking on the date in the form, then a drop-down menu will appear from which you can choose the required date. Follow the same process for the time as well.</p><p>Once you click save, the meeting will be confirmed and appear on your Google Calendar.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Google-Meet-Link-and-Code"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Google-Meet-Link-and-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the Google Meet Link and Code?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the Google Meet Link and Code?</h2><p>There are numerous ways through which you can get the link to the session.</p><ul><li>Get a link from Google Calendar</li><li>Get a link from Google Meet</li></ul><p>If you are using Google Calendar to get the link, the process is fairly simple. Just go onto the Google Calendar homepage and if you have scheduled the event from before, click on the event you require a Google Meet link for. Upon Clicking on the event a popup will appear as shown below.</p><p>From the popup, click the “Copy Conference Info” button to get the link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-join-with-google-meet-link-calendar.jpg"                      alt="join  google meet on Google Calendar"                ></p><p>On a split side, one can also get their hands on the link through Google Meet itself. They can go to the homepage and they will see a list of scheduled events for that day over there.</p><p>From there just click the event you require a link for and you will be redirected to the meeting joining page. From there, just copy the link from the search bar and voila, you are good to go!</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-Permanent-Link"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-Permanent-Link" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Create Google Meet Permanent Link"></a>Part 5: How to Create Google Meet Permanent Link</h2><p>Tired of creating the same meetings again and again? Then why not just create a recurring link, also known as a permanent link. The process of creating a permanent link is the same as scheduling a Google Meet through Google Calendar, except one additional step has been added.</p><p>Before clicking save, click the “Repeat” option and select the days you would like the meeting to repeat itself. Then for all those days, the same link will be used.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-permanent-link.jpg"                      alt="create  google meet permanent link"                ></p><p><strong>Are You Ready To Start Creating Your Own Google Meet Conferences?</strong></p><p>Google Meet guarantees secure and easily accessible meetings to its users. It provides you with an extremely simple layout on the website and Google Meet app for your devices, with all the instructions already present; it really doesn’t get easier than this!</p><p>You can share links of the meetings you have created, join with links, schedule meetings for the future and much more!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Google Meet is a very popular video conferencing tool nowadays.

Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail"></a>1. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail</h3><p>Scheduling a session through Gmail is fairly simple, for this all the user requires is access to a Gmail account and they are good to go. First what one must do is sign into their Gmail account and go to the homepage.</p><p>On the left side of their screen, they will see options under the “Meet” heading, one is “New Meeting” and the other is “Join a Meeting”. If you are looking to create a new meeting then click on the “New Meeting” option.</p><p>Once that option is clicked, the user will be redirected to a new page that contains a meeting link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gmail-google-meet-invitation-link.jpg"                      alt=" google meet invitation link on Gmail"                ></p><p>Over here there are three options. By clicking the “copy link” button, individuals can copy and share the link with people they would like to invite to the meeting.</p><p>If they want to directly share the link, they can also click the “Send Invite” button and copy the meeting invite from there as well as share via email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-meet-invite-link-gmail.jpg"                      alt="share google meet invitation link on Gmail"                ></p><p>Upon clicking the “Share Via Email” option, users will be redirected to a new tab where they can see an email pop up and from there, they can invite participants to the session through their email address, as indicated in the image below.</p><p>If individuals want to instantly create and start the session, they can click the “Start Now” option, and the meeting will automatically start.</p><h3 id="2-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Calendar-3"><a href="#2-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Calendar-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar"></a>2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar</h3><p>Another way to create a Google Meet session is through the Google Calendar. Much like the process of creating it through Gmail, there are a few steps involved, but the process is very easy.</p><p>First individuals must go to the Google Calendar homepage and click the “Create” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-session-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="create google meet  on google calendar"                ></p><p>After clicking the create option, the screen will show two options; “ Event” and “Task”. Click the event option and a pop-up form will show up on the window which must be filled to create a Google Meet event.</p><p>Fill in the form, if you would like to invite participants to the Google Meet conference, you can also list down their email address in the “Add Guests” section. Once you have done that click the “Add Google Meet Video Conferencing” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-google-meet-video-conferencing-calendar.jpg"                      alt="add google meet  on google calendar"                ></p><p>An event link will appear in the form, along with a button that says “Join With Google Meet”.

All you have to do is go to the Google Meet homepage and click the “New Meeting” button.</p><p>Upon clicking the button, you will see three options. From that click the “Start an Instant Meeting” option and you will be redirected to a new conference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-schedule-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Create schedule google meet"                ></p><p>These are the three highly recommended ways to create a Google Meet session instantly, but remember, to make use of any of these options, you must have a Gmail account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-on-Android-iPhone-iPad-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-on-Android-iPhone-iPad-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create Google Meet on Android&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Part 2: How to Create Google Meet on Android&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Google Meet comes with an option for groups to create video conferences on their mobile and tablet devices as well. Whether you are using an Android device or iOS, you can easily create a meeting!</p><p>One thing to remember is that in order to create Google Meet sessions through a mobile or tablet device is that one must download the application of Google Meet.</p><p>Once the application has been downloaded into your device, open the Google Meet app to its homepage and two options will appear in front of you: “New Meeting ‘’ and “Join With a Code’’. To create Google Meet sessions, click the “New Meeting’’ option.</p><p>Upon clicking that button, three new options will appear:</p><ul><li>Get a meeting link to share - use this when you would like to create a meeting link and share it with other invitees and start the meeting after some time</li><li>Start an instant meeting - make use of this option if you would like to automatically join the meeting and then share the link with participants later on</li><li>Schedule in Google Calendar - use this option when you would like to create a meeting for the future.

If you are looking to create an event for the future, first give it a title in the title section. Then move on to the date and time section and set the date to a time in the future for when you require the session to take place.</p><p>You can change the date by clicking on the date in the form, then a drop-down menu will appear from which you can choose the required date.

Key Features of CamStudio"></a>Part 2. Key Features of CamStudio</h2><p>Instead of being a completely free screen recorder, CamStudio allows several customization options so that the recording could be as per your requirements. Even though the features are limited, here are the key features of CamStudio recorder you should be aware of.</p><p>Video Recording – You can record your screen as well as webcam video individually as well as simultaneously.</p><p>Audio Recording – Along with videos, you can record audio from your system as well as external microphone.

Instead of a fixed region, you can vary the region of recording as per your requirement.</p><p>Add Components – There is an option for adding annotations if you need it. Besides, you can attach a fixed watermark or text to the recorded video. Moreover, you can add a timestamp on the video if you have such requirements.</p><p>Autopan and Others – Autopan is a unique feature of CamStudio screen recorder whereby you can record as you move your mouse.

Alternative Way to Record Screen"></a>Part 3. Alternative Way to Record Screen</h2><p>CamStudio is an easy-to-use and completely free screen recorder, but it lacks several useful features. First of all, there is no basic editing option available. The output file format is limited. There are very limited customizable configuration settings available. Moreover, CamStudio is only suitable for Windows users. The user interface is outdated, and it is not suitable for recording very high-quality screen videos such as gameplay. That is why there is a need for a better CamStudio alternative.</p><p>If you are looking for a professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, we recommend Wondershare Filmora.
