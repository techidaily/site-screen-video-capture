ShareX Alternatives"></a>Part 3. ShareX Alternatives</h2><p>ShareX is not the ideal software to use if your intention is to record your screen. ShareX is the best screenshot capturing tool. Capturing screen video as well as webcam video involves complicated steps. Besides, it lacks necessary customizable settings for recording video as well as there is hardly any editing option for the recorded video.</p><p>Coming to the user interface, it is rather clumsy and not at all intuitive. Besides, ShareX Mac version is not available, and hence, the recorder is only suitable for Windows users. Considering all these drawbacks, it is better to opt for a better alternative. Here are the best ShareX alternatives you should definitely try out.</p><h3 id="Filmora"><a href="#Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora is the best ShareX alternative as it is a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >premium video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and editor.

OBS Studio allows you to record your screen as well as from any external video producing devices starting from webcam to gaming consoles.</p><p>You can capture video from multiple video sources and switch between scenes instantly. Moreover, you can record while streaming. The issue with OBS Studio is that the user interface is not very user-friendly, and hence, the software puts pressure on performance of the system while recording high-quality videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-streaming-videos-online.jpg"                      alt="obs streaming videos online"                ></p><h3 id="Fraps"><a href="#Fraps" class="headerlink" title="Fraps"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Fraps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Fraps is another premium screen recorder where you need to pay one-time free only for unlimited recording.

However, the settings are not highly customizable while recording and the lack of features is a huge concern if you want to record regularly. That is why we have recommended the best ShareX alternatives, and our top pick is Wondershare Filmora which is easy to use and feature-rich.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Once you are done recording your screen video, you can edit it like a pro.

This is particularly important to ensure that the sound and look on video is good. Look for a location with minimal background noise and without echoes to make e sure your voice sounds clear. Also, make sure your background is not distracting background and allows your audience to focus on the subject.</li><li><strong>Setting your camera</strong>: make sure to set the camera at the eye level. In doing so, your viewers will have a natural feeling while watching the video. This level creates a realistic feeling like you are talking to them in person.</li><li><strong>Framing</strong>: With good framing, you can properly present yourself to the audience. By being at the center of the frame, the top of your head and mid-chest will be easily visible. This also helps to ensure that you leave some space above the head to avoid the frame feeling cluttered.</li><li><strong>Lighting</strong>: When recording indoors, find a room that has plenty of natural light but avoid direct sunlight when recording outdoors. In situations where you are using additional light sources, make sure they are in front of you and your face is evenly lit.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, you have understood how to record video with webcam on Mac for free using QuickTime Player and Photo Booth. iMovie is another great app for Mac users to record webcam.

This is particularly important to ensure that the sound and look on video is good. Look for a location with minimal background noise and without echoes to make e sure your voice sounds clear. Also, make sure your background is not distracting background and allows your audience to focus on the subject.</li><li><strong>Setting your camera</strong>: make sure to set the camera at the eye level. In doing so, your viewers will have a natural feeling while watching the video. This level creates a realistic feeling like you are talking to them in person.</li><li><strong>Framing</strong>: With good framing, you can properly present yourself to the audience. By being at the center of the frame, the top of your head and mid-chest will be easily visible. This also helps to ensure that you leave some space above the head to avoid the frame feeling cluttered.</li><li><strong>Lighting</strong>: When recording indoors, find a room that has plenty of natural light but avoid direct sunlight when recording outdoors. In situations where you are using additional light sources, make sure they are in front of you and your face is evenly lit.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, you have understood how to record video with webcam on Mac for free using QuickTime Player and Photo Booth. iMovie is another great app for Mac users to record webcam.

This is particularly important to ensure that the sound and look on video is good. Look for a location with minimal background noise and without echoes to make e sure your voice sounds clear. Also, make sure your background is not distracting background and allows your audience to focus on the subject.</li><li><strong>Setting your camera</strong>: make sure to set the camera at the eye level. In doing so, your viewers will have a natural feeling while watching the video. This level creates a realistic feeling like you are talking to them in person.</li><li><strong>Framing</strong>: With good framing, you can properly present yourself to the audience. By being at the center of the frame, the top of your head and mid-chest will be easily visible. This also helps to ensure that you leave some space above the head to avoid the frame feeling cluttered.</li><li><strong>Lighting</strong>: When recording indoors, find a room that has plenty of natural light but avoid direct sunlight when recording outdoors. In situations where you are using additional light sources, make sure they are in front of you and your face is evenly lit.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, you have understood how to record video with webcam on Mac for free using QuickTime Player and Photo Booth. iMovie is another great app for Mac users to record webcam.

Although with the right app or software, you can record a good video, making a few adjustments can lead to even better outcomes. Here are a few tips to improve the quality of your video recording with a Mac webcam.</p><ul><li><strong>Finding a good spot:</strong> Your video recording can make a huge difference when it comes to creating a video. This is particularly important to ensure that the sound and look on video is good. Look for a location with minimal background noise and without echoes to make e sure your voice sounds clear. Also, make sure your background is not distracting background and allows your audience to focus on the subject.</li><li><strong>Setting your camera</strong>: make sure to set the camera at the eye level. In doing so, your viewers will have a natural feeling while watching the video. This level creates a realistic feeling like you are talking to them in person.</li><li><strong>Framing</strong>: With good framing, you can properly present yourself to the audience. By being at the center of the frame, the top of your head and mid-chest will be easily visible. This also helps to ensure that you leave some space above the head to avoid the frame feeling cluttered.</li><li><strong>Lighting</strong>: When recording indoors, find a room that has plenty of natural light but avoid direct sunlight when recording outdoors. In situations where you are using additional light sources, make sure they are in front of you and your face is evenly lit.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, you have understood how to record video with webcam on Mac for free using QuickTime Player and Photo Booth. iMovie is another great app for Mac users to record webcam.

However, today Skype group chat makes it possible for anyone to connect and collaborate with several people without any barriers and limitations.</p><p>To make a group chat on Skype using a Windows operating system you can get connected with individuals from diverse localities of the world within a minute. To make a Skype group chat for yourself follow along with the steps below.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.skype.com/"><strong>Download Skype</strong></a> on your Windows PC. You’ll need to sign in with a Microsoft account or sign up if you haven’t already had a Skype account.</li><li>Once you’ve logged in to Skype you’ll be presented with a similar interface with “Recent Chats” showing up in the left pane. To make a group chat click on the drop-down icon next to the “New Chat” button and select “New Group Chat” and your new Skype group chat is only a few clicks away.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-group-chat1.jpg"                      alt="new group chat"                ></p><ul><li>A new window will appear in the Skype main screen. Here you’ll have to write the name of the group and select a picture for the group chat. The name should represent the purpose of the chat group to make sense to its participants, I’ve selected a figurative name for the sake of an example. After you’re done with the name and picture, press the ahead arrow.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-group-name2.jpg"                      alt="create group name"                ></p><ul><li>Skype will take you to your contact list to choose the members for your new chat group. You can skimp through the whole list or search the name in the search bar to look for a particular person. Once you’re done selecting all your contacts press the “Done” button and Skype will create your new shiny group within a minute.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/finish-create-group3.jpg"                      alt="finish create group"                ></p><ul><li>You’ll be taken directly to the new group chat you just created.

While the company also allows you to report the contact as abusive which can notify the company moderators to stop the spammers from an early stage and not allow them to torture other Skype users.</p><p>You can in effect block a contact in Skype</p><ul><li>1. Go to the “Recent Chats” or “Contacts” tab and select the contact you want to block.</li><li>2. Right-click the contact name and chose the “View profile” option from the menu.</li><li>3. In the profile of the contact, member scroll down to the bottom of the profile window and click the red colored “Block contact” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/block-contact4.jpg"                      alt="block contact"                ></p><ul><li>4.

Generally, to delete a contact you’ll have to view the person’s profile details and then press the “Remove from contact list” option, but here I’ll be showing you a fairly easy and simple way to delete all your contacts at once.</p><p>To delete all your Skype contacts at once follow the steps:</p><ul><li>1. Open Skype app and press the menu bar right next to your name. Select “Settings” to open the settings of Skype.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-settings6.jpg"                      alt="skype settings"                ></p><ul><li>2. In the settings go to the “Contacts” tab on the left sidebar. This will show all the settings for contacts, go to “Privacy” settings.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/contact-tab7.jpg"                      alt="contact tab"                ></p><ul><li>3. In the Privacy settings, you will see all the other details. We need to go into the “View list” under the Profile section. This will reveal all your contacts in a list.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-list8.jpg"                      alt="view list"                ></p><ul><li>4. In the list, you’ll be presented with all your contacts. Deleting them is very easy, just left-click each or dotted menu option and select “Delete contact”.

Go to the “Recent Chats” or “Contacts” tab and select the contact you want to block.</li><li>2. Right-click the contact name and chose the “View profile” option from the menu.</li><li>3. In the profile of the contact, member scroll down to the bottom of the profile window and click the red colored “Block contact” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/block-contact4.jpg"                      alt="block contact"                ></p><ul><li>4.

Generally, to delete a contact you’ll have to view the person’s profile details and then press the “Remove from contact list” option, but here I’ll be showing you a fairly easy and simple way to delete all your contacts at once.</p><p>To delete all your Skype contacts at once follow the steps:</p><ul><li>1. Open Skype app and press the menu bar right next to your name. Select “Settings” to open the settings of Skype.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-settings6.jpg"                      alt="skype settings"                ></p><ul><li>2.

This will show all the settings for contacts, go to “Privacy” settings.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/contact-tab7.jpg"                      alt="contact tab"                ></p><ul><li>3. In the Privacy settings, you will see all the other details. We need to go into the “View list” under the Profile section. This will reveal all your contacts in a list.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-list8.jpg"                      alt="view list"                ></p><ul><li>4. In the list, you’ll be presented with all your contacts. Deleting them is very easy, just left-click each or dotted menu option and select “Delete contact”. This way you won’t have to go into each contact’s profile to delete the particular contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-contact9.jpg"                      alt="delete contact"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Skype group chats allow multiple people to communicate face-to-face through time, space, and culture.

Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone. While it was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, it later made its debut in:</p><ul><li>Xbox one</li><li>PlayStation Vita</li><li>iOS</li><li>Android</li><li>MacOS</li><li>Linux, and even;</li><li>PlayStation 4</li></ul><p>Are you wondering what makes this game interesting? Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit. If you never knew, Stardew Valley Ginger Island is filled with fun activities as well as puzzles.</p><h2 id="Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>It must be clearly stated that Stardew Valley Ginger Island is where the majority of the new content of Stardew Valley takes place. If you never knew, the 1.5 update of Stardew Valley has a whole lot to offer, ranging from new items, areas, places to build your farm, and even some new characters.</p><p>Above all, Ginger Island is most likely the most significant part of the Stardew Valley 1.5 update. For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat. When you get to the Ginger Island while playing the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game, you will meet Leo.

It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular.

For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island.

When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ultimate-Tutorial-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS"><a href="#Ultimate-Tutorial-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Ultimate Tutorial: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS"></a>Ultimate Tutorial: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS</h2><p>OBS Studio is arguably the best free, open-source screen recorder for Mac, Windows, and Linux computers. It packs powerful features that make screen recording fun, engaging, and convenient. But in this guidepost, we’ll dwell on the little-known <strong>OBS countdown timer</strong>.</p><p>So, what is the OBS Studio countdown timer, and why do you need to make one? This article discusses that and how to add a countdown timer overlay to your local videos using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?"></a>Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?</h2><p>You probably don’t need a further introduction to a countdown timer if you’re often watching action movies or marking calendars. But clear doubts, a countdown timer is basically the remaining time in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds before a start of an event. A good example is those James Bond movies where a bomb has, let’s say, 60 seconds before exploding.</p><p>With that said, you can use the <strong>OBS timer countdown</strong> in multiple ways. For example, you can use it to pump up excitement before a much anticipated live streaming session starts. Remember that OBS Studio supports live streaming to popular platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-1.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer"                ></p><p>So, the timer will tell viewers the duration they’ll have to wait before the next live session. You can even add an action text after the timer ends. A countdown timer can also help you ensure that the viewer sticks around until the end of an event or video.</p><p>Picture this; you can be a fitness trainer on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, etc. In that case, you’ll need to perform each set of exercises for a specific duration, then rest for like 30 or 60 seconds.</p><p>So, add a timer to the video to guide the trainees throughout the session. This helps make the session more engaging and fun. Whichever the reasons you have to add an <strong>OBS count down timer</strong>, the objective is simple; communicate to the viewers the time left before an event starts or ends.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS"></a>Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS</h2><p>Up to this point, you might think that adding an OBS countdown clock is such a complicated task. After all, OBS isn’t the most beginner-friendly screen recorder to use. But don’t fret because adding a countdown timer is one of the most straightforward things to do in OBS Studio. Let’s do that!</p><p>Step1 Fire up OBS Studio and select a recording scene on which you want to apply the countdown timer. Once the scene is ready, tap the Plus button on the Sources section, then select the Text Source. Now give the source a name. For instance, you can name it Timer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-2.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add a text source"                ></p><p>Step2 Now you’ll see a pop-up window to customize how the timer will look. For example, click the Select font button to customize the font settings for the countdown timer. You can also customize things like opacity, gradient, background color, alignment, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-3.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer customize timer details"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, click the Tools tab and then tap Scripts. Then, select the countdown.lua file and customize the countdown descriptions on the pop-up window. You can change the countdown duration and the final text after the countdown. Don’t also forget to select Timer as the Text Source. The OBS countdown timer will immediately start counting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-4.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add the timer file"                ></p><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer"></a>Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer</h2><p>You’ll definitely need precise timing to get the most out of the <strong>timer countdown on OBS</strong>. Also, sometimes you can record a video on your smartphone or camera and customize it with a countdown timer. If that’s the case, consider using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It’s a professional-grade video editor for macOS and Windows systems that allows you to add countdown timer overlays to any video. Unlike OBS, this method will enable you to add timer overlays to specific scenes on the footage, including the intro part. Even best is that the countdown timers come in multiple styles, and you can customize the timer with appropriate background audio.</p><p><strong>Steps to create a countdown timer with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h5 id="Step1-Start-a-new-video-project"><a href="#Step1-Start-a-new-video-project" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Start a new video project"></a>Step1 Start a new video project</h5><p>Install and run Filmora on your PC, and start a New Project. But before that, select the video aspect ratio. This is important if you’re creating videos for social media sharing. For example, choose 16:1 for YouTube and 4:3 for WhatsApp Status videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-5.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add new project"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Upload-the-video-to-edit"><a href="#Step2-Upload-the-video-to-edit" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Upload the video to edit"></a>Step2 Upload the video to edit</h5><p>Tap Import Media to upload a video from local or external drives.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Get to Know Screen Recorder Pro"></a>Part 1. Get to Know Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 is a completely free screen recording app. The app does not have any premium service to upgrade. Even though it is available free of cost, the features and functionalities are enough for high-quality screen recording activity. You can not only record the screen activities but also from the webcam. Moreover, you can record only a selected area of the screen rather than the entire screen. Here is the list of features Screen Recorder Pro has to offer.</p><p><strong>Key Features –</strong></p><ul><li>Record all screen activities on any application.</li><li>Capture screen with or without mouse cursor.</li><li>Record the entire screen or specific area and screen.</li><li>Capture click and keystrokes effectively.</li><li>Record video from webcam with audio.</li><li>Capture audio from microphone as well as speakers.</li><li>Save in different formats like MP4, AVI, and GIF.</li><li>Capture screenshots instead of videos if required.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Record-with-Screen-Recorder-Pro-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Record-with-Screen-Recorder-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Download and Record with Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>The features of the application seem to be great for capturing any screen activities. Besides, there are various advanced options available such as record specific areas or record without cursor. These advance options are generally available in premium screen recorders, but you are getting them for free on Screen Recorder Pro. Therefore, you should definitely download the application on your PC and use it for screen recording. Here are the steps to download –</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Microsoft Store.</p><p>Step 2: Search for “screen recorder pro for win10”.</p><p>Step 3: Select the first app from the search result page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/search-recorder-pro-store.jpg"                      alt="search recorder from store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click on Get button to download and install Screen Recorder Pro APK automatically.</p><p>Once the downloading is complete, you can launch the application from the Start menu.</p><p>Here are the steps to follow to record any screen on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Launch Screen Recorder Pro application from Start menu.</p><p>Step 2: You need to configure the parameters such as video encoder, FPS, quality, audio source and likewise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="launch screen recorder pro"                ></p><p>Step 3: You have to select full screen(monitor icon) or custom screen(area icon at the extreme right corner).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="screen recorder pro customize screen"                ></p><p>Step 4: Finally, click on Record button to start recording.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Other Alternative to Record Screen on Windows 10</h2><p>If you are not satisfied with the video quality and certain features that Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 has to offer, you can opt for better alternatives. Here are the best alternatives to record screen on Windows 10.</p><h3 id="Filmora-3"><a href="#Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora is a professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that has a built-in video editor. Therefore, you do not need separate applications for recording the screen and editing out video like a pro. Besides, the application is suitable for all types of recordings starting from application screen and webcam to videos games and web interfaces.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-recording-screen.jpg"                      alt="wondershare screen recorder"                ></p><p>Most importantly, you can capture at 4K resolution and you can add voiceover if you want. As far as the editor goes, you can add sound effects, video effects, transitions, and filters. Moreover, you can insert captions, drawings, and stickers and you can do green screen recording.

It is true that these games are not very graphically intense and can’t compete for the AAA titles, but it won’t be fair to compare them with those heavy and graphics-intensive games. Played repeatedly, these games continue to keep players interested even after they are released for years. But who cares that much if you’re just looking for some good rogue game to play.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-roguelike-game-What-is-a-roguelite-game"><a href="#What-is-a-roguelike-game-What-is-a-roguelite-game" class="headerlink" title="What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?"></a>What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?</h2><p>Gamers have been debating whether roguelikes are different from roguelites for years. If you study them in general, you will find that both roguelikes and roguelites are the RPGs subgenres. In general, roguelikes and roguelites place more emphasis on death than other kinds of video games do.</p><p>You might have a question in your mind that what is a <strong>roguelike game</strong>? It is a convoluted category of games, but it had a clear beginning. It all started with an early dungeon crawling game, “Rogue” in 1980. At that time, computers were very limited in their speed and memory capabilities.</p><p>You have to give credit to the computer programmers because instead of taking the low memory capacity of computers as a limitation at that time, they developed a game and introduced the concept of “procedural generation to save the memory space.” If you have ever played a game that has randomly generated level systems and each time gives you a unique experience, then you have already tried a roguelike game or a roguelite game.</p><p>In roguelikes, players’ progress is usually lost if they die, while in roguelites, rewards or progression are usually saved between runs. This is the main difference between roguelikes and roguelites. Although there are many other differences, let’s focus on discussing the best roguelike games and roguelite games present today.</p><p><strong>Want a more detailed explanation?

So, let’s get started without wasting any time.</p><hr><h2 id="1-Darkest-Dungeon"><a href="#1-Darkest-Dungeon" class="headerlink" title="1.Darkest Dungeon"></a><strong>1.<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/262060/Darkest%5FDungeon/" >Darkest Dungeon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platform:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 24.99.</em></p><p>In Darkest Dungeon, your misery is manifest all around you. The oppressive visuals, brutal difficulty, and extreme bleakness make the game feel so oppressive in the extreme. With its dungeons and scavenger hunts, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, looking for treasure and gold.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/darkest-dungeon.png"                      alt="darkest-dungeon"                ></p><p>It’s one thing to defeat each dungeon’s horrifying inhabitants in turn-based combat, but your party members should also be more than meat shields. Your expeditions will inevitably take a toll on your body and mind, and this is the main reason that makes Darkest Dungeon so challenging.</p><p>Your tactical instincts will be put to the test when it comes to teamwork and resource allocation. This is undoubtedly one of the best roguelikes to be found.</p><h2 id="2-Downwell"><a href="#2-Downwell" class="headerlink" title="2.Downwell"></a><strong>2.<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/Downwell/" >Downwell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC, iOS, Android</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 2.99.</em></p><p>Only a couple of minutes to complete each run, this roguelike takes us on an adventure on the inside. As you dive deeper into an endless well filled with dangerous creatures, you are only protected by a pair of deadly gumboots that kill enemies, slowing down your fall for a moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/downwell.png"                      alt="downwell"                ></p><p>Don’t let its retro look fool you. This 2015 title is fast and intense, with a good amount of power-ups that boost your survivability. It is immediately enjoyable with its fast-paced downward action, but gaining mastery of its combat is no simple feat. Downwell is one of the best roguelikes out there, despite its intense difficulty. Its concise levels, satisfying combo system, and creative boss are among the roguelikes’ best features.</p><h2 id="3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup"><a href="#3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup" class="headerlink" title="3. Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup"></a><strong>3. <a class="link"   href="https://crawl.develz.org/" >Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Android, Web browser</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>Free To Play</em></p><p>The successor to the 1997’s roguelike Liney’s Dungeon Crawl, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is another best roguelike game. Although there is a considerable saturation in the roguelike titles these days, we had to include this classic title in the best roguelike games list because it deserves a spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><p>Each item, class, spell, and trait in this community-developed game has hundreds of hidden interactions that just heighten your enjoyment every time you play. Each floor increases the game’s difficulty, and as you go deeper, it becomes harder to decide whether to fight or flee.</p><h2 id="4-Hades"><a href="#4-Hades" class="headerlink" title="4. Hades"></a><strong>4. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/" >Hades <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong>   <em>Nintendo Switch, macOS, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh operating systems</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 8.49.</em></p><p>Hades is a masterpiece when it comes to dungeon crawling and roguelike games. Your character is Hades’ son, Zagreus, trying to escape from the Underworld and make his way to Mount Olympus. Hades’ cyclical narrative is presented through its procedural runs and a compelling story and evocative cast of characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hades.png"                      alt="hades"                ></p><p>Many blessings have been given to you by the gods of Olympus, but your quest is not an easy one. A game like this will enthrall you and entice you to keep playing until you get some better stuff for your characters. After each failure, you are resurrected in your own house, the House of Hades, where your friends and family await your following conversation. It is one of the best roguelike titles out there.</p><h2 id="5-Into-the-Breach"><a href="#5-Into-the-Breach" class="headerlink" title="5. Into the Breach"></a><strong>5. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into%5Fthe%5FBreach/" >Into the Breach <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Switch, PC</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 6.99</em></p><p>This is the second title developed and published by Subset Games. Their first title was FTL: <strong><em>Faster Than Light</em></strong> in 2012. FTL could have taken this spot, but Into the Breach’s design and hidden depth make it stand out among the competition. It’s a game of turn-based tactics where your team is faced with an army of monsters known as the Vek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/into-the-breach.png"                      alt="into-the-breach"                ></p><p>There’s only one way to hold off their attack, and that is to enlist some giant mechs. But you’ll have to agonize over every decision if you intend to keep your team intact. The more you progress through the game’s islands, the more advanced equipment you’ll find, so you can turn the tide of war and save humankind.</p><p>This is one of the most accessible strategy games out there, and its straightforward combat won’t offend novices, but you should expect something more challenging, though rewarding, from Into the Breach.</p><h2 id="6-Slay-the-Spire"><a href="#6-Slay-the-Spire" class="headerlink" title="6. Slay the Spire"></a><strong>6. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay%5Fthe%5FSpire/" >Slay the Spire <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 8.49.</em></p><p>It foregoes combat mechanics solely in favor of strategy and premonition in a deck-building roguelike. You have no choice but to battle your way up the tower, which is also home to many monsters. This is an ideal entry point to the single-player card battler genre as it does away with the pre-battle faff.

It is true that these games are not very graphically intense and can’t compete for the AAA titles, but it won’t be fair to compare them with those heavy and graphics-intensive games. Played repeatedly, these games continue to keep players interested even after they are released for years.

What is a roguelite game?"></a>What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?</h2><p>Gamers have been debating whether roguelikes are different from roguelites for years. If you study them in general, you will find that both roguelikes and roguelites are the RPGs subgenres. In general, roguelikes and roguelites place more emphasis on death than other kinds of video games do.</p><p>You might have a question in your mind that what is a <strong>roguelike game</strong>? It is a convoluted category of games, but it had a clear beginning. It all started with an early dungeon crawling game, “Rogue” in 1980. At that time, computers were very limited in their speed and memory capabilities.</p><p>You have to give credit to the computer programmers because instead of taking the low memory capacity of computers as a limitation at that time, they developed a game and introduced the concept of “procedural generation to save the memory space.” If you have ever played a game that has randomly generated level systems and each time gives you a unique experience, then you have already tried a roguelike game or a roguelite game.</p><p>In roguelikes, players’ progress is usually lost if they die, while in roguelites, rewards or progression are usually saved between runs. This is the main difference between roguelikes and roguelites. Although there are many other differences, let’s focus on discussing the best roguelike games and roguelite games present today.</p><p><strong>Want a more detailed explanation?

The oppressive visuals, brutal difficulty, and extreme bleakness make the game feel so oppressive in the extreme. With its dungeons and scavenger hunts, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, looking for treasure and gold.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/darkest-dungeon.png"                      alt="darkest-dungeon"                ></p><p>It’s one thing to defeat each dungeon’s horrifying inhabitants in turn-based combat, but your party members should also be more than meat shields. Your expeditions will inevitably take a toll on your body and mind, and this is the main reason that makes Darkest Dungeon so challenging.</p><p>Your tactical instincts will be put to the test when it comes to teamwork and resource allocation.

This 2015 title is fast and intense, with a good amount of power-ups that boost your survivability. It is immediately enjoyable with its fast-paced downward action, but gaining mastery of its combat is no simple feat. Downwell is one of the best roguelikes out there, despite its intense difficulty. Its concise levels, satisfying combo system, and creative boss are among the roguelikes’ best features.</p><h2 id="3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-1"><a href="#3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Although there is a considerable saturation in the roguelike titles these days, we had to include this classic title in the best roguelike games list because it deserves a spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><p>Each item, class, spell, and trait in this community-developed game has hundreds of hidden interactions that just heighten your enjoyment every time you play.

Your character is Hades’ son, Zagreus, trying to escape from the Underworld and make his way to Mount Olympus. Hades’ cyclical narrative is presented through its procedural runs and a compelling story and evocative cast of characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hades.png"                      alt="hades"                ></p><p>Many blessings have been given to you by the gods of Olympus, but your quest is not an easy one. A game like this will enthrall you and entice you to keep playing until you get some better stuff for your characters. After each failure, you are resurrected in your own house, the House of Hades, where your friends and family await your following conversation. It is one of the best roguelike titles out there.</p><h2 id="5-Into-the-Breach-1"><a href="#5-Into-the-Breach-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

Their first title was FTL: <strong><em>Faster Than Light</em></strong> in 2012. FTL could have taken this spot, but Into the Breach’s design and hidden depth make it stand out among the competition. It’s a game of turn-based tactics where your team is faced with an army of monsters known as the Vek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/into-the-breach.png"                      alt="into-the-breach"                ></p><p>There’s only one way to hold off their attack, and that is to enlist some giant mechs. But you’ll have to agonize over every decision if you intend to keep your team intact. The more you progress through the game’s islands, the more advanced equipment you’ll find, so you can turn the tide of war and save humankind.</p><p>This is one of the most accessible strategy games out there, and its straightforward combat won’t offend novices, but you should expect something more challenging, though rewarding, from Into the Breach.</p><h2 id="6-Slay-the-Spire-1"><a href="#6-Slay-the-Spire-1" class="headerlink" title="6.

The oppressive visuals, brutal difficulty, and extreme bleakness make the game feel so oppressive in the extreme. With its dungeons and scavenger hunts, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, looking for treasure and gold.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/darkest-dungeon.png"                      alt="darkest-dungeon"                ></p><p>It’s one thing to defeat each dungeon’s horrifying inhabitants in turn-based combat, but your party members should also be more than meat shields. Your expeditions will inevitably take a toll on your body and mind, and this is the main reason that makes Darkest Dungeon so challenging.</p><p>Your tactical instincts will be put to the test when it comes to teamwork and resource allocation. This is undoubtedly one of the best roguelikes to be found.</p><h2 id="2-Downwell-2"><a href="#2-Downwell-2" class="headerlink" title="2.Downwell"></a><strong>2.<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/Downwell/" >Downwell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC, iOS, Android</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 2.99.</em></p><p>Only a couple of minutes to complete each run, this roguelike takes us on an adventure on the inside. As you dive deeper into an endless well filled with dangerous creatures, you are only protected by a pair of deadly gumboots that kill enemies, slowing down your fall for a moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/downwell.png"                      alt="downwell"                ></p><p>Don’t let its retro look fool you. This 2015 title is fast and intense, with a good amount of power-ups that boost your survivability. It is immediately enjoyable with its fast-paced downward action, but gaining mastery of its combat is no simple feat. Downwell is one of the best roguelikes out there, despite its intense difficulty. Its concise levels, satisfying combo system, and creative boss are among the roguelikes’ best features.</p><h2 id="3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-2"><a href="#3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Although there is a considerable saturation in the roguelike titles these days, we had to include this classic title in the best roguelike games list because it deserves a spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><p>Each item, class, spell, and trait in this community-developed game has hundreds of hidden interactions that just heighten your enjoyment every time you play.

Your character is Hades’ son, Zagreus, trying to escape from the Underworld and make his way to Mount Olympus. Hades’ cyclical narrative is presented through its procedural runs and a compelling story and evocative cast of characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hades.png"                      alt="hades"                ></p><p>Many blessings have been given to you by the gods of Olympus, but your quest is not an easy one. A game like this will enthrall you and entice you to keep playing until you get some better stuff for your characters. After each failure, you are resurrected in your own house, the House of Hades, where your friends and family await your following conversation. It is one of the best roguelike titles out there.</p><h2 id="5-Into-the-Breach-2"><a href="#5-Into-the-Breach-2" class="headerlink" title="5.

Their first title was FTL: <strong><em>Faster Than Light</em></strong> in 2012. FTL could have taken this spot, but Into the Breach’s design and hidden depth make it stand out among the competition. It’s a game of turn-based tactics where your team is faced with an army of monsters known as the Vek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/into-the-breach.png"                      alt="into-the-breach"                ></p><p>There’s only one way to hold off their attack, and that is to enlist some giant mechs. But you’ll have to agonize over every decision if you intend to keep your team intact. The more you progress through the game’s islands, the more advanced equipment you’ll find, so you can turn the tide of war and save humankind.</p><p>This is one of the most accessible strategy games out there, and its straightforward combat won’t offend novices, but you should expect something more challenging, though rewarding, from Into the Breach.</p><h2 id="6-Slay-the-Spire-2"><a href="#6-Slay-the-Spire-2" class="headerlink" title="6.

You have no choice but to battle your way up the tower, which is also home to many monsters. This is an ideal entry point to the single-player card battler genre as it does away with the pre-battle faff. It’s also a surprising roguelike that blends options from your adventures to create an instantaneous action experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><p>The game, released in 2017, has gained massive audience recognition thanks to its 10&#x2F;10 Steam rating and over 60,00 reviews despite its simplistic art and simplistic interface. It is considered the best deck-builder roguelike in the market, so if you haven’t tried it already, you miss out a lot.</p><h2 id="7-Crypt-of-the-Necrodancer-2"><a href="#7-Crypt-of-the-Necrodancer-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

This game was released in 2015, featuring catchy soundtracks and groovy boss fights — a distinct title for gamers looking for a new challenge. While you’re running out of time before your next move, Crypt of the Necrodancer will have you tapping your foot and dripping with sweat as you keep ongoing.</p><p>This game deviates from roguelike conventions, forcing players to arrive at snappy judgments quickly. While quick decision-making and foresight are required in the genre, the escalating rhythm forces players to maintain a higher tempo to maintain a strong combo, and all you know is, you can’t lose the combo. If you haven’t tried this game yet, then it’s worth your time and money.</p><h2 id="8-Dead-Cells-2"><a href="#8-Dead-Cells-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

You revolve around procedurally generated dungeon exploration in search of blueprints for better gear. The dungeon hosts a multitude of tough-as-nails enemies, which make finding these schematics no easy task.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><p>Various upgrades can be carried over between runs, generating a constant sense of progression. Because of this, starting a new run after a particularly messy boss fight doesn’t sting quite as much as many other roguelike games might be. There are many different weapon types and perks to unlock in Dead Cells, making it more replayable and keeps it from being monotonous.</p><h2 id="9-The-Binding-of-Isaac-2"><a href="#9-The-Binding-of-Isaac-2" class="headerlink" title="9.

With its action-adventure elements fused with shooters, the game is an outright sick action-adventure with an acquired taste that has become cult.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-binding-of-isaac.png"                      alt="binding-of-issac"                ></p><p>In addition to some captivating gameplay, the game contains some compelling storytelling, with Biblical references providing a nice hint of lore. Although decisions are essential in roguelikes, you may also need to be quick with your reaction times with some bullet hell-style bosses.</p><h2 id="10-Otherworld-Legends-2"><a href="#10-Otherworld-Legends-2" class="headerlink" title="10.

With its dungeons and scavenger hunts, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, looking for treasure and gold.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/darkest-dungeon.png"                      alt="darkest-dungeon"                ></p><p>It’s one thing to defeat each dungeon’s horrifying inhabitants in turn-based combat, but your party members should also be more than meat shields. Your expeditions will inevitably take a toll on your body and mind, and this is the main reason that makes Darkest Dungeon so challenging.</p><p>Your tactical instincts will be put to the test when it comes to teamwork and resource allocation. This is undoubtedly one of the best roguelikes to be found.</p><h2 id="2-Downwell-3"><a href="#2-Downwell-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Downwell"></a><strong>2.<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/Downwell/" >Downwell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC, iOS, Android</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 2.99.</em></p><p>Only a couple of minutes to complete each run, this roguelike takes us on an adventure on the inside. As you dive deeper into an endless well filled with dangerous creatures, you are only protected by a pair of deadly gumboots that kill enemies, slowing down your fall for a moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/downwell.png"                      alt="downwell"                ></p><p>Don’t let its retro look fool you. This 2015 title is fast and intense, with a good amount of power-ups that boost your survivability. It is immediately enjoyable with its fast-paced downward action, but gaining mastery of its combat is no simple feat. Downwell is one of the best roguelikes out there, despite its intense difficulty. Its concise levels, satisfying combo system, and creative boss are among the roguelikes’ best features.</p><h2 id="3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-3"><a href="#3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup"></a><strong>3. <a class="link"   href="https://crawl.develz.org/" >Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Android, Web browser</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>Free To Play</em></p><p>The successor to the 1997’s roguelike Liney’s Dungeon Crawl, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is another best roguelike game. Although there is a considerable saturation in the roguelike titles these days, we had to include this classic title in the best roguelike games list because it deserves a spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><p>Each item, class, spell, and trait in this community-developed game has hundreds of hidden interactions that just heighten your enjoyment every time you play. Each floor increases the game’s difficulty, and as you go deeper, it becomes harder to decide whether to fight or flee.</p><h2 id="4-Hades-3"><a href="#4-Hades-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Hades"></a><strong>4. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/" >Hades <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong>   <em>Nintendo Switch, macOS, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh operating systems</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 8.49.</em></p><p>Hades is a masterpiece when it comes to dungeon crawling and roguelike games. Your character is Hades’ son, Zagreus, trying to escape from the Underworld and make his way to Mount Olympus. Hades’ cyclical narrative is presented through its procedural runs and a compelling story and evocative cast of characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hades.png"                      alt="hades"                ></p><p>Many blessings have been given to you by the gods of Olympus, but your quest is not an easy one. A game like this will enthrall you and entice you to keep playing until you get some better stuff for your characters. After each failure, you are resurrected in your own house, the House of Hades, where your friends and family await your following conversation. It is one of the best roguelike titles out there.</p><h2 id="5-Into-the-Breach-3"><a href="#5-Into-the-Breach-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Into the Breach"></a><strong>5. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into%5Fthe%5FBreach/" >Into the Breach <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Switch, PC</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 6.99</em></p><p>This is the second title developed and published by Subset Games. Their first title was FTL: <strong><em>Faster Than Light</em></strong> in 2012. FTL could have taken this spot, but Into the Breach’s design and hidden depth make it stand out among the competition. It’s a game of turn-based tactics where your team is faced with an army of monsters known as the Vek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/into-the-breach.png"                      alt="into-the-breach"                ></p><p>There’s only one way to hold off their attack, and that is to enlist some giant mechs. But you’ll have to agonize over every decision if you intend to keep your team intact. The more you progress through the game’s islands, the more advanced equipment you’ll find, so you can turn the tide of war and save humankind.</p><p>This is one of the most accessible strategy games out there, and its straightforward combat won’t offend novices, but you should expect something more challenging, though rewarding, from Into the Breach.</p><h2 id="6-Slay-the-Spire-3"><a href="#6-Slay-the-Spire-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Slay the Spire"></a><strong>6. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay%5Fthe%5FSpire/" >Slay the Spire <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 8.49.</em></p><p>It foregoes combat mechanics solely in favor of strategy and premonition in a deck-building roguelike. You have no choice but to battle your way up the tower, which is also home to many monsters. This is an ideal entry point to the single-player card battler genre as it does away with the pre-battle faff. It’s also a surprising roguelike that blends options from your adventures to create an instantaneous action experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><p>The game, released in 2017, has gained massive audience recognition thanks to its 10&#x2F;10 Steam rating and over 60,00 reviews despite its simplistic art and simplistic interface. It is considered the best deck-builder roguelike in the market, so if you haven’t tried it already, you miss out a lot.</p><h2 id="7-Crypt-of-the-Necrodancer-3"><a href="#7-Crypt-of-the-Necrodancer-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Crypt of the Necrodancer"></a><strong>7. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt%5Fof%5Fthe%5FNecroDancer/" >Crypt of the Necrodancer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux, Classic Mac OS, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 14.99.</em></p><p>This rhythm-based roguelike game hits a sweet spot combining two niche genres. This game was released in 2015, featuring catchy soundtracks and groovy boss fights — a distinct title for gamers looking for a new challenge. While you’re running out of time before your next move, Crypt of the Necrodancer will have you tapping your foot and dripping with sweat as you keep ongoing.</p><p>This game deviates from roguelike conventions, forcing players to arrive at snappy judgments quickly. While quick decision-making and foresight are required in the genre, the escalating rhythm forces players to maintain a higher tempo to maintain a strong combo, and all you know is, you can’t lose the combo. If you haven’t tried this game yet, then it’s worth your time and money.</p><h2 id="8-Dead-Cells-3"><a href="#8-Dead-Cells-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Dead Cells"></a><strong>8. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead%5FCells/" >Dead Cells <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS, Android</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 8.49.</em></p><p>Dead Cells is a 2D and Souls-inspired roguelike game. You revolve around procedurally generated dungeon exploration in search of blueprints for better gear. The dungeon hosts a multitude of tough-as-nails enemies, which make finding these schematics no easy task.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><p>Various upgrades can be carried over between runs, generating a constant sense of progression. Because of this, starting a new run after a particularly messy boss fight doesn’t sting quite as much as many other roguelike games might be. There are many different weapon types and perks to unlock in Dead Cells, making it more replayable and keeps it from being monotonous.</p><h2 id="9-The-Binding-of-Isaac-3"><a href="#9-The-Binding-of-Isaac-3" class="headerlink" title="9. The Binding of Isaac"></a><strong>9. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The%5FBinding%5Fof%5FIsaac/" >The Binding of Isaac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, 3DS, iOS</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 2.99.</em></p><p>An indie roguelike developed by Super Meat Boy creator Edmund McMillen, The Binding of Isaac is an action-packed adventure game. With its action-adventure elements fused with shooters, the game is an outright sick action-adventure with an acquired taste that has become cult.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-binding-of-isaac.png"                      alt="binding-of-issac"                ></p><p>In addition to some captivating gameplay, the game contains some compelling storytelling, with Biblical references providing a nice hint of lore. Although decisions are essential in roguelikes, you may also need to be quick with your reaction times with some bullet hell-style bosses.</p><h2 id="10-Otherworld-Legends-3"><a href="#10-Otherworld-Legends-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Otherworld Legends"></a><strong>10. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chillyroom.zhmr.gp&hl=en&gl=US" >Otherworld Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Android, iOS</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>Free</em></p><p>Otherworld Legends is a mystery roguelite where you explore a mysterious and dangerous realm while discovering the mystery hidden within it. This requires equal measures of skill and perseverance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-other-world-legends.png"                      alt="the-other-world-legends"                ></p><p>As you journey through various dungeon rooms in this game, you defeat all enemies you encounter. This is similar to the binding of Isaac series of games and Elemental Dungeon. Some relics are also found or bought from time to time. These items give you powerful advantages in combat, which can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><p>The main character of this game is Quan Huying, but there are several other characters you can choose from. You need to buy additional characters, though. They differ in cost, and some are $1.99 while others can be upwards of $2.99. It’s not expensive for me, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily ideal.</p><p>The Otherworld Legends game is incredibly entertaining to play with beautiful graphics, and enjoyable setting, and a cast of interesting characters. If you’re looking for entertaining games to pass the time, the Otherworld Legends games are an excellent choice.</p><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> you wanna record your gameplay and upload to YouTube?

The Best AZ Screen Recorder Alternatives For PC And Mac</h2><p>Like AZ Screen Video Recorder, there are many other mobile applications offering screen recording functionalities. However, these apps cannot compete with their desktop counterparts that come with more robust features and controls.</p><p>Following are the reasons why you might want to consider using a desktop recorder:</p><p><strong>Larger Recording Areas:</strong> Mobile devices have small screens, so you are limited to selecting the area of a screen to record. However, this is not the case with desktop recorders which offers more area and even allow you to set a custom section of the screen for recording.</p><p><strong>Video Editing</strong>: Unlike mobile apps, many desktop screen recording software programs also offer basic video editing capabilities, such as trimming, adding annotations, and more.</p><p><strong>More Features:</strong> In general, desktop screen recording applications have more features than their mobile counterparts.</p><p>With that being discussed, we recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - a one-of-its-kind software that has many powerful capabilities, such as screen recording, video editing, speed ramping, royalty-free library, and more.</p><p>Here’s how you can use Filmora software to record a screen or webcam on a PC or Mac:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Step1 Launch a browser, visit the official <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>website to download the software, and install it on your PC&#x2F;Mac.</p><p>Step2 Now, run the software on your PC&#x2F;Mac and click <strong>“Create New Project.”</strong> Go to the top toolbar, click <strong>“File”</strong> and head to the “Record Media” option. Select the option you want. We selected <strong>“Record PC Screen.”</strong></p><p>Step3 From the <strong>“Wondershare Screen Recorder”</strong> window, set up which part of the screen you want to record, i.e., full screen, custom, or target screen recording. Set the speaker and microphone settings and click the <strong>drop-down</strong> icon for more <strong>Settings.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/filmora-recorder-window.png"                      alt="filmora recorder window"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, select the <strong>Start</strong> icon to begin your video.
