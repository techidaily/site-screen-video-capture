Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams are free to use, and although they charge for extra functions, there aren’t additional costs for virtual background. We’ve contributed know-how to ensure your guests only focus on you and not what’s behind your back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/zoom-blur-background.jpg"                      alt="zoom blur background"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What to Consider Before Blurring the Background in Zoom?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Blur the Background in Zoom: A Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to blur the background of any video?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-to-Consider-Before-Blurring-the-Background-in-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-What-to-Consider-Before-Blurring-the-Background-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What to Consider Before Blurring the Background in Zoom?"></a><strong>Part 1: What to Consider Before Blurring the Background in Zoom?</strong></h2><p>Zoom can blur everything in the screen’s background with the tap of a button, which can save you from uploading an image to hide your screen’s background. Here’s how to get started before you learn how to blur the background in Zoom.</p><h4 id="1-–-Here-to-look-for-the-blue-background-on-Zoom"><a href="#1-–-Here-to-look-for-the-blue-background-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="1 – Here to look for the blue background on Zoom"></a>1 – Here to look for the blue background on Zoom</h4><p>Primarily, make sure that you are looking at your laptop’s Zoom Client. First, open Zoom; tap the <strong>Settings</strong> icon at the top right corner. From there, select “<strong>Backgrounds and Filters</strong>” in the sidebar popup. Then, follow our step-by-step guide to blur Zoom background from there.</p><h4 id="2-–-Update-Zoom-to-get-the-Blur-Background"><a href="#2-–-Update-Zoom-to-get-the-Blur-Background" class="headerlink" title="2 – Update Zoom to get the Blur Background"></a>2 – Update Zoom to get the Blur Background</h4><p>Ensure that the computer system is up to date and supports the latest version of Zoom. To check for updates, tap your profile picture of your <strong>Zoom Desktop Client</strong> at the top-right corner, then scroll down and tap where it says “<strong>Check for Updates</strong>.”</p><p>If you’ve already downloaded the latest version, restart your computer and open Zoom again to see if it shows up.</p><h4 id="3-–-Check-Your-Computer-Requirements"><a href="#3-–-Check-Your-Computer-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="3 – Check Your Computer Requirements"></a>3 – Check Your Computer Requirements</h4><p>Alternatively, you can check for Client and processor requirements. All the information related to requirements compatibility is available on the Zoom help page for virtual background requirements.</p><p>To check the compatibility, go to “<strong>Backgrounds and Filters</strong>“ and uncheck the box that says “<strong>I have a green screen</strong>“ under “<strong>Virtual Backgrounds</strong>.”</p><p>Next, hover over your list of virtual backgrounds. In case you get an error message pointing you need a green screen to support virtual backgrounds, your computer doesn’t support the blur background feature.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Blur-the-Background-in-Zoom-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Blur-the-Background-in-Zoom-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Blur the Background in Zoom: A Step-by-Step Guide"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Blur the Background in Zoom: A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></h2><p>Given below are the ultimate steps on how to blur the background in Zoom via different sections</p><h4 id="Steps-to-Blur-Background-on-Windows-10-before-Zoom-call"><a href="#Steps-to-Blur-Background-on-Windows-10-before-Zoom-call" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Blur Background on Windows 10 before Zoom call"></a>Steps to Blur Background on Windows 10 before Zoom call</h4><p>Steps related to background blur before your Zoom call:</p><ol><li>Install Zoom and log in to your account.</li><li>Click on the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ gear icon option at the top-right corner.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/zoom-settings-tab.jpg"                      alt="zoom settings"                ></p><ol><li>In “Settings,” select “Backgrounds and Filters.”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/select-zoom-filters.jpg"                      alt="select zoom filters"                ></p><ol><li>Then select the “<strong>Blur</strong>” option.
