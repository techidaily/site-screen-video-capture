The built-in screen recorder will pop up</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen-2.jpg"                      alt="filmora-record-pc-screen-2"                ></p><ul><li>4. You can go to the recording settings by the Settings icon, and set the hotkeys for your recording. Or you can also enable the option by checking the Record the Camera Stream to record your webcam simultaneously and also adjust the frame rate.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-settings.jpg"                      alt="record-settings"                ></p><ul><li>5. Once you are done with the settings, Click the Red button to start the recording.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen-4.jpg"                      alt="filmora-record-pc-screen-4"                ></p><ul><li>6. Now you can call your mate and start video sharing on Skype. The whole screen sharing process will be recorded by Filmora. After you finish the recording, the recorded file will show up in the media library automatically. You can right-click it, select <strong>Reveal in Explorer</strong> to target it on your Desktop folders.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt="find-recorded-file"                ></p><p>Note:</p><p>The steps to record screen on Mac are similar to Windows.</p><h4 id="To-Sum-up"><a href="#To-Sum-up" class="headerlink" title="To Sum up"></a>To Sum up</h4><p>The use of applications like Skype and Filmora has made working from home easier than ever before. Sharing screen, online meetings, seminars, demonstrations, etc. can easily be done sitting at home with the help of these apps.

You did not have the facility to store anything, and hence in due course, gradually, it faded away from your memory. Time has changed for the better now. We are in a new age of technology where we can work in a more innovative and organized way. You can practically capture anything you see and hear around you in the present era. Hence, be it your classroom notes or lectures or any similar process, you do not have to cause pain to your wrist.

If you’d like to find out more about making video tutorials you’ve come to the right place because, in this guide, we will take you through each step of how to make a video tutorial. So let’s get started.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Preparing Before Making Video Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Using Right Screen Recording Software for Step-by-Step Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Recording Professional Audio</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Capturing Tutorial Video</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Editing Recorded Tutorial Video</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Sharing the Video Tutorial With Your Audiences</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Summary for Next Tutorial Video</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Preparing-for-the-Tutorial-Making-Process-3-Tips"><a href="#Part-1-Preparing-for-the-Tutorial-Making-Process-3-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparing for the Tutorial Making Process [3 Tips]"></a>Part 1: Preparing for the Tutorial Making Process [3 Tips]</h2><p>The amount of video content uploaded to the Internet on a daily basis is staggering, to say the least. That’s why your video tutorials need to offer something unique in order to stand out in the sea of similar content. The process of making a tutorial starts long before you hit the record button, and here are a few tips that will help you be prepared for the challenges you might face while making your first video tutorial.</p><h4 id="1-Define-the-Target-Audience-and-Pick-the-Right-Topics"><a href="#1-Define-the-Target-Audience-and-Pick-the-Right-Topics" class="headerlink" title="1. Define the Target Audience and Pick the Right Topics"></a>1. Define the Target Audience and Pick the Right Topics</h4><p>Who are the people you are trying to reach? Finding the answer to this simple question is going to help you solve a variety of common issues video content producers have to deal with. By defining the target audience you’ll be able to discover the best way to approach them.</p><p>What’s more, once you understand who the viewers of your tutorials are, you’ll be able to pick the subjects that spark the most interest within the group you’re targeting. It goes without saying that knowing everything there is to know about the topics you’re covering is an absolute must if you are hoping to attract large audiences to your videos.</p><h4 id="2-Make-a-Content-Plan"><a href="#2-Make-a-Content-Plan" class="headerlink" title="2. Make a Content Plan"></a>2. Make a Content Plan</h4><p>The best way to approach the process of tutorial video production is to define your goals and the course of action long before you start recording. You should write down all the ideas and concepts you have in your head. Once you’ve formulated the concept you’ll be able to see how many videos you have to make in order to cover all the ins and outs of a topic.</p><p>Try to find natural stopping points or thematic units in your list and decide how many videos you’ll have to create so you can offer a comprehensive and informative view on the subject. Including too much information in one video may discourage the viewers to follow the tutorial until the end. You should take into consideration the concept of the cognitive load while deciding how long your videos should be. This concept points out that there’s a limit to how much and how fast an average person can learn, so offering too much information in a single video can end up being counterproductive.</p><p>If the topic of your video tutorial is complex you should provide explanations through practical examples, even if it takes a lot of screen time, rather than jumping from one subject to another. Here are a few tips that will help you figure out how to structure your video tutorial series.</p><p><strong>Your concept must have a clear beginning, middle and the end:</strong> This is a basic rule of storytelling that helps you guide the viewer through the topic of your tutorials. You should use the same principle when recording each video in the series.</p><p><strong>How much time a certain topic demands:</strong> Covering more than one topic in a video is possible, although before you decide to do so, you should make sure that the topics you want to include in the tutorial have something in common.</p><p><strong>How much information is too much:</strong> Keeping the viewer’s attention glued to what’s going on in the tutorial is your primary goal. That’s why you need to find the right measure of information you provide in each video. By offering less information in each video, you’re giving viewers the time to process it and understand it better.</p><p>Once you’ve created thematic units you can proceed to write a script for each video. These scripts don’t have to be detailed, you can just create a few bullet points to guide you through the video.</p><h4 id="3-Record-in-a-Clean-Work-Environment"><a href="#3-Record-in-a-Clean-Work-Environment" class="headerlink" title="3. Record in a Clean Work Environment"></a>3. Record in a Clean Work Environment</h4><p>Everything displayed on your computer’s monitor is going to be recorded, so before you start a screen capturing session make sure that all of your private data is well outside the work environment you’ll be using in the video. Instead of wasting time on concealing private information in the post-production, you can save time by controlling what is visible in the portion of the screen you are capturing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Choosing-Best-Screen-Recorder-for-Video-Tutorial-Making"><a href="#Part-2-Choosing-Best-Screen-Recorder-for-Video-Tutorial-Making" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Choosing Best Screen Recorder for Video Tutorial Making"></a>Part 2: Choosing <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for Video Tutorial Making</h2><p>Having the right tools for a job is as equally important as knowing exactly how to do a certain job. There are so many different screen recorders on the market at the moment, that choosing the right one isn’t always such an easy task. Most free software products that offer the screencasting feature have limitations that may prevent you from creating a high-quality tutorial.</p><p>If you want to capture videos at high frame rates, select the region of the screen you’re recording by yourself or record high-resolution footage we recommend using Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Scrn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Besides featuring powerful screen capturing tools, the software also has a video editing mode, that allows you to edit your videos immediately after you finish a screencasting session. You can use this software to record all your desktop activities on Mac and PC computers for free, and you can purchase the perpetual license to use it for just $29.99 or a one-year license at $19.99.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19080710&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smart-seo-tool.com/images/SmartSEOAuditorBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Audio-Recording-A-Few-Tips-for-Recording-Better-Audio"><a href="#Part-3-Audio-Recording-A-Few-Tips-for-Recording-Better-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Audio Recording: A Few Tips for Recording Better Audio"></a>Part 3: Audio Recording: A Few Tips for Recording Better Audio</h2><p>Video tutorials largely depend on narration, because you have to use your voice to explain what is going on in the video. That’s why you have to pay special attention to the quality of sound in your videos. Tutorials with poor audio quality have fewer chances of attracting large audiences, simply because most people don’t want to watch a video if they can’t understand what you are saying. Here’s how you can improve the quality of audio in your video tutorials.</p><h4 id="1-Use-the-right-Microphone"><a href="#1-Use-the-right-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="1. Use the right Microphone"></a>1. Use the right <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Whether or not you should record audio with an external microphone is not the real question you should be asking. The real issue is which type of external microphone you should use. Omnidirectional microphones pick up background noises easily, so in order to record clear and natural narration, you should use a unidirectional microphone that only picks up sounds that are coming from one direction.</p><h4 id="2-Add-Background-Music-if-necessary"><a href="#2-Add-Background-Music-if-necessary" class="headerlink" title="2.Add Background Music if necessary"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Add Background Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if necessary</h4><p>Music can help you create a pleasant atmosphere in your video tutorials and it can partially cover the background noise. There are numerous websites that grant you access to royalty free music, which means that it shouldn’t be too hard to find the track you want to include in the tutorial. You should just make sure that the voiceover is clearly audible because you don’t want the music to be louder than the narrator’s voice.</p><h4 id="3-Record-in-an-optimized-acoustic-environment"><a href="#3-Record-in-an-optimized-acoustic-environment" class="headerlink" title="3. Record in an optimized acoustic environment"></a>3. Record in an optimized acoustic environment</h4><p>Sometimes background noise can completely destroy the audio recording you captured. So, in order to avoid this turn off all home appliances that create atmospheric noises. In addition, the room in which you are recording should have great acoustics, because even the slightest reverb can influence the sound quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Capturing-a-Video-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-4-Capturing-a-Video-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Capturing a Video Tutorial"></a>Part 4: Capturing a Video Tutorial</h2><p>Note: There are so many screen recording software available on the market as we described before. But here, we will take Filmora Scrn as an example.</p><p>Once you’ve prepared a clean working environment, attached the external microphone to your computer, it is time to start your first screencasting session.

Furthermore, you can add callouts if you want to draw the viewer’s attention to a, particularly important detail.</p><h4 id="6-Add-text-boxes-to-guide-your-viewers"><a href="#6-Add-text-boxes-to-guide-your-viewers" class="headerlink" title="6. Add text boxes to guide your viewers"></a>6. Add text boxes to guide your viewers</h4><p>You can easily provide information about your upcoming video tutorials by adding text overlays to your videos. You just have to select the font, size, or color of the text and find the best place for it on the screen. Try to keep text you use in a video as short as possible, because too much text may distract the viewer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713321&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVDJ1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV DJ Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-6-Sharing-the-Video-Tutorial-With-Your-Audiences"><a href="#Part-6-Sharing-the-Video-Tutorial-With-Your-Audiences" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Sharing the Video Tutorial With Your Audiences"></a>Part 6: Sharing the Video Tutorial With Your Audiences</h2><p>After you’ve completed the video editing process, you should export the video in a file format that can be easily be uploaded to the Internet.</p><h4 id="1-Where-to-upload-a-video-tutorial"><a href="#1-Where-to-upload-a-video-tutorial" class="headerlink" title="1. Where to upload a video tutorial?"></a>1. Where to upload a video tutorial?</h4><p>The most obvious choice is YouTube because it is the world’s largest video sharing platform. However, options such as Vimeo or even Facebook may produce equally impressive results. The eLearning websites, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Udemy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or <a class="link"   href="https://www.skillshare.com/" >Skillshare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are also worth considering if your plan is to produce video tutorials on a professional level.</p><h4 id="2-Optimize-the-video-description"><a href="#2-Optimize-the-video-description" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize the video description"></a>2. Optimize the video description</h4><p>Using keywords in the video description will secure better search results. Choose keywords that are directly related to the topic your video is covering, because you will gain nothing if the video appears in search results for unrelated subjects. There are a lot of different tools online you can use to discover the best keywords for your video tutorials, including the Google AdWords Keyword Planner Tool.</p><h4 id="3-Write-a-related-blog-post"><a href="#3-Write-a-related-blog-post" class="headerlink" title="3. Write a related blog post"></a>3. Write a related blog post</h4><p>One of the best ways to promote your video tutorials is to write blogs about the topics you are covering because you can use the videos to offer more info about the subject. That way you’ll direct readers towards the tutorial and you’ll be able to generate more traffic.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=32667153&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.coolmuster.com/uploads/image/20201228/feature02.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-7-Summarize-and-Improve-for-Next-Video-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-7-Summarize-and-Improve-for-Next-Video-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Summarize and Improve for Next Video Tutorial"></a>Part 7: Summarize and Improve for Next Video Tutorial</h2><p>Don’t expect your first video tutorial to be a major success, that’s going to attract millions of views. But what you can do is keep track of the number of hits the video got, pay attention to the comments, suggestions or critique and try to do better in the next video. There are many different tools you can use to monitor a video’s performance, including YouTube Analytics if you’re using this platform.</p><p>Developing your video making skills and using the feedback you get to increase the quality of the content you’re producing is probably the most important aspect of the entire process. Failing to find ways to improve the video tutorials you’re making may result in a low number of views and their overall poor performance on the Internet, so you should do everything in your power to constantly find new ways of reaching new audiences and delivering high-quality tutorials to your audience.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The process of creating a video tutorial is rather simple since you only have to designate the region of the screen you’d like to capture, make sure that the microphone is functioning properly and hit the record button. The Internet offers plenty of opportunities to share your work with millions of people and to help them learn new skills or solve problems that are preventing them from moving forward in their careers.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Efficient-OBS-Usage-Live-Skype-Capture-Tips"><a href="#Efficient-OBS-Usage-Live-Skype-Capture-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Efficient OBS Usage: Live Skype Capture Tips"></a>Efficient OBS Usage: Live Skype Capture Tips</h2><p>Video interviews for remote jobs are quite common these days because of this quickening pace of the world around us. And these interviews are recorded to further evaluate the information exchanged, so for the recording of these videos certain tools have also been introduced in the market. I myself have used a few of them; and the most popular these days are easily zoom and skype. Both these programs offer clear communication among all concerned parties. The reason why I want to discuss skype here is that zoom’s video quality is an issue, it has got very low video quality and the audio, it records in one track so if you have made a mistake in the speaking or something audible, it will remain there.</p><p>So in this article I will discuss that how can you record your skype videos using OBS. Skype has been extensively used for quite a long time now and it hasn’t lost its edge over the years but has actually upgraded and improved its services with time. Coming to OBS which is an open-source software used widely for streaming purposes. It provides an incredible experience courtesy of its variety of editing and recording options. The audio can be recorded from the system and the microphone. And video can be fetched from the webcam. Along with the recording of specific section of the screen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS"></a>Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS</h2><p>To begin with shedding some light on the OBS program:</p><p>A little piece of software that can be used for both business and non-commercial purposes. Streaming on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook is supported. It has the ability to record the screen with cursor effects. It allows you to record your screen indefinitely. Watermarks aren’t added: the video doesn’t have any watermarks. There are options for multichannel, Multilanguage, and single channel.</p><p>Now to setup the environment for screen recording we have to follow the following steps.</p><p>Initially, you’ll be required to have skype installed on your desktop along with the up-to-date version of OBS software. After installing skype you first have to make a secondary&#x2F;backup account on skype. After that you require a secondary camera as well to record yourself because your webcam can be in demand elsewhere, so you would not be able to record yourself or even the guests wouldn’t be able to see you. And then turn on the given command in skype i-e: skype&gt;settings&gt;calling&gt;advanced&gt;’allow NDI usage’ as shown in the picture. This command allows OBS to access skype videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-calling-settings-advanced-calling.jpg"                      alt="skype calling settings advanced calling"                ></p><p>After this you have to open the OBS program and set it up for skype calls, firs thing is to create a new scene, then you’re going to hit the plus button and select the capture device. Now you can see yourself on camera and screen can easily be cropped, while holding ‘Alt’, on OBS so fix it according to your liking. Then press ‘lock’ using the NDI plug-in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-program-set-up-for-skype.jpg"                      alt="obs program set up for skype"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-vlc-videos-source.jpg"                      alt="obs vlc videos source"                ></p><p>To setup NDI plugin you have to visit <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases/tag/4.9.1" >https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases/tag/4.9.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and check for the compatible version with your operating system. On this website the plugin is available for windows, mac and Linux.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obc-ndi-plugin-visit.jpg"                      alt="obc ndi plugin visit"                ></p><p>And after addition of plug in you would want to click on ‘+’ again and select NDI plugin and you can select the source video which is going to be the received video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-additon-of-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="obs additon of plug in"                ></p><p>And clicking on it will open a new window where you have to select the guest feed, which will be possible once the call has begun. The call connected will appear on the NDI plugin window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-new-window-select-the-guest-feed.jpg"                      alt="obs new window select the guest feed"                ></p><p>As you receive the call from the reciever you will see the incoming feed of him as shown in the figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-receive-the-call.jpg"                      alt="obs receive the call"                ></p><p>So you can just resize it similarly as you did yours earlier and pressing the lock icon will stop you from mistakenly modify or change the video screen settings. Now to record the video you have to click on record button and your desktop starts recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-resize-it-similarly.jpg"                      alt="obs resize it similarly"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-OBS-Alternative-to-Record-Skype"><a href="#Part-2-OBS-Alternative-to-Record-Skype" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: OBS Alternative to Record Skype"></a>Part 2: OBS Alternative to Record Skype</h2><h3 id="Filmora"><a href="#Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Filmora is a very popular and perfect <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and editor designed by Wondershare.

There are options for changing the audio devices for your own computer. And I recommend that you separate your audio right now. Everything is set up in a way that everything’s going to come through one audio feed. I don’t like that. I think it’s better if you separate your audio that. Let’s say you cough during an interview or something. You’re actually able to cut that out and you can actually record a separate feed itself.</p><p><strong>Capturing Audio in OBS Studio on a Mac</strong></p><p>On a Mac, you’ll need to install an additional OBS plugin to capture audio.</p><ul><li>Install iShowU Audio Capture on your computer.</li><li>Make sure you navigate to Security &amp; Privacy in your System Preferences.</li><li>To proceed, you may need to grant permission to “Shiny White Box.”</li><li>Restart your Mac after the installation is complete.</li><li>Open Audio MIDI Setup after rebooting.</li><li>At the bottom left of the window, click the Plus button.</li><li>Select Create Multi-Output Device from the drop-down menu.</li></ul><p>So form the above discussion it can be concluded that OBS for screen recording can be a very handy tool because it has the ability to easily record skype videos along with separate audio recording to avoid interference of sounds and mix ups. The separate audio recording system allows us to manipulate and modify the sounds along with the video quality. Skype is a tool much used by the world for quite some time and it still continues to serve us with numerous improvements and updates to simplify the complex world of networking today and the tools to use it properly help us communicate better with others.

None, however, have been stretched as far as roguelikes and roguelites. You’ve probably heard these terms used to describe recent hit games such as <em>Hades</em>, <em>Dead Cells,</em> and <em>Binding of Isaac</em> and have wondered if there’s a difference. While both of these game types share a lot of common elements and the lines between them are seemingly blurred, there is a clear distinction between roguelikes and roguelites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/isaac-poster.jpg"                      alt="isaac-poster"                ></p><hr><p><strong>This article contains:</strong></p><hr><p>Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Roguelikes and Roguelites?</p><hr><h3 id="Rogue-Where-it-all-started"><a href="#Rogue-Where-it-all-started" class="headerlink" title="Rogue: Where it all started"></a>Rogue: Where it all started</h3><p>In order to best understand these two game genres, we must first analyze the origin of their namesakes. Way back in 1980, game designers Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman released an ASCII art dungeon crawler called <em>Rogue</em>. Inspired by the pen-and-paper RPG <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, this turn-based adventure game had players explore dungeons in which they fought monsters and gathered items to help them power up their characters. The game’s defining mechanic was <strong>permadeath</strong>. This meant that once your character died, it was literally the end. You couldn’t create a save nor revive your fallen hero in any way. Starting over meant a completely fresh game with a brand new character. What’s more is that starting a new game meant the dungeons were completely different, including enemy placement, room location, and item distribution. Every decision could mean either living and carrying on or dying and starting over, making the choices players made meaningful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/michael-toy-glenn-wichman.jpg"                      alt="michael-toy-glenn-wichman"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelike-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelike-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelike Game?"></a>What is a Roguelike Game?</h2><p>As the name implies, a roguelike - or roguelike - is a game that shares the same mechanics that defined <em>Rogue</em>. They have procedurally generated environments, making every playthrough feel completely fresh and different. Dying in a roguelike means all progress is lost, and you need to start over, no saves, no lives, no ifs nor buts. It’s at this juncture where some debate exists as to what truly defines a roguelike. There are fans out there who’ll tell you that a roguelike must not only share the mechanics but also the game’s layout and combat system. According to them, since <em>Rogue</em> was a top-down third-person turn-based RPG that played on a grid, all true roguelikes should then play and look the same. The other camp sees roguelikes as purely defined by true permadeath with some leniency afforded with regards to less important elements such as player perspective, combat systems, and screen orientation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rogue-poster.jpg"                      alt="rogue-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelite-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelite-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelite Game?"></a>What is a Roguelite Game?</h2><p>Roguelites - or rogue-lites - in essence, employ a lighter approach to implementing <em>Rogue</em>‘s key characteristics. For the most part, roguelites still have permadeath. If you die, then you have to start over. However, the <strong>key difference</strong> is that roguelites allow you to carry over some form of progress from one playthrough to the next. Depending on the game, the way progress is carried over varies. Some games allow you to unlock additional items that can drop in a given run. Others open up access to new areas or provide you with abilities that enable you to traverse towards new locations and expand your area of exploration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlock-hades.jpg"                      alt="unlock-hades"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp; Hard Disk Manager</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Roguelites also have procedurally generated environments in a lot of cases. There are titles that have completely random level layouts and enemy placements. Others draw from a pre-defined set of layouts that are mixed and matched. Some titles may simply randomize more minute elements such as item placement and the locations of points of interest. Another way roguelites differ in the way they handle procedural generation is through seeded runs. A seed is essentially a run with pre-determined parameters, including enemy types and placements, level layout, and item availability. Seeding is also used to generate special challenge runs as well as enable custom modes. Whatever the case, roguelites have a tendency to reign in the chaos of fully procedurally generated game content.</p><p>It’s roguelites that are also usually a mix of different genres with <em>Rogue</em> style mechanics. From action RPGs to card games, the roguelite genre’s offerings are quite expansive. The leniency they give when it comes to permadeath and randomness affords developers more design space in which they can craft unique experiences.</p><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe id="iframe_672" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/gen-ad-code/5597632/1959812/17834/" width="720" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end -->## A Clear Distinction<p>Regardless of where you stand on what defines a faithful roguelike, the distinction between it and roguelites is quite straightforward. You know you are playing a roguelike when dying means you <strong>lose it all</strong>. No matter how far into the game you’ve progressed, one misstep means all of the time and work you put into your progress has come to an end. Roguelites, on the other hand, prefer to give you <strong>some sense of progression</strong>, making them <strong>friendlier</strong> for players who don’t want to play with the stress of potentially losing everything.</p><p>There’s an argument to be made that roguelikes give you a truly unique experience each time while roguelites end up becoming grindy and repetitive. When every little decision you make can lead you to lose your character and progress, you become more focused on your run, rather than the game as a whole. You’re forced to play your best, scrutinize every possible choice, and make meaningful comparisons between items and gear you come across. The risk is higher when playing roguelikes, but the reward and payoff of making it far in a run are quite big.</p><p>If you were to conclude that roguelikes are for the <strong>hardest of core gamers</strong> and roguelites are more <strong>casual</strong> in nature, you would be quite close to the mark. A lot of roguelite titles, however, have difficulty settings that can turn them into absolutely brutal experiences, rendering progress and unlocks less important than the player’s overall skill.</p><hr><p>Part 2: Examples of Roguelike and Roguelite Titles</p><p>If you’ve been meaning to dive into either or both of these genres, we’ve got a few titles for you to check out.</p><p><strong>You might also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Roguelike or Roguelite Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h3 id="Roguelike-Games"><a href="#Roguelike-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelike Games"></a>Roguelike Games</h3><p>For this list, we’re using the “true” definition of roguelike, meaning games that are almost exactly like <em>Rogue</em>.</p><h4 id="Nethack"><a href="#Nethack" class="headerlink" title="Nethack"></a>Nethack</h4><p><em>Nethack</em> is considered one of the most important roguelikes as it is as close to <em>Rogue</em> as a game can get. Apart from permadeath and procedurally generated environments, it shares a lot of <em>Rogue’s</em> core attributes, including the ASCII art style and screen layout. Compared to <em>Rogue</em>, <em>Nethack</em> has a much larger collection of enemies and items, making exploring its world more rewarding. <em>Nethack</em> also includes “conducts” which are special limitations players can choose to impose upon themselves in order to make the game even more challenging.</p><h4 id="Caves-of-Qud"><a href="#Caves-of-Qud" class="headerlink" title="Caves of Qud"></a>Caves of Qud</h4><p>Straying a bit from <em>Rogue’s</em> high fantasy setting, <em>Caves of Qud</em> mixes some science fiction into its world. Just like <em>Rogue</em>, dying means your progress goes caput. Environments, however, are only partially generated randomly, with some elements being pre-defined. The game also includes a robust mutation system to power up your character as well as quests and side-quests which you can choose to follow or ignore. On top of all this, <em>Caves of Qud</em> adds another layer of randomness through its procedurally generated political systems.</p><h4 id="Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup"><a href="#Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup" class="headerlink" title="Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup"></a>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</h4><p>Recognized as one of the best roguelikes of all time, <em>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</em> is one of the true innovators of its space. Taking all of the core defining elements of <em>Rogue</em>, including its hyper retro art style, <em>DCSS</em> makes a concerted effort towards being more accessible. For starters, it offers a more user-friendly interface that brings all important information to the forefront. The developers also wanted to make its gameplay far easier to understand so that any person can pick it up and play without needing any convoluted prior knowledge of how the game works.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Roguelite-Games"><a href="#Roguelite-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelite Games"></a>Roguelite Games</h3><p>For this genre, we’ve chosen three games that are completely different to illustrate the wider variety of titles that exists within the roguelite space.</p><h4 id="Dead-Cells"><a href="#Dead-Cells" class="headerlink" title="Dead Cells"></a>Dead Cells</h4><p><em>Dead Cells</em> is an exploration-based action platformer (a.k.a. a metroidvania) with roguelite elements. Just like all _Rogue_-based games, dying in <em>Dead Cells</em> means you start over from the beginning. However, not <strong>all progress</strong> is lost. As you progress through various biomes of the game, you’ll unlock new traversal abilities that allow you to access new biomes and pathways. While some randomness exists in each biome, it feels less like levels are procedurally generated and more like a mixing of pre-determined layout components. You’ll also stumble upon blueprints for items which you can then spend Cells you gather to make the items available to drop in future runs. By beating the game’s final boss you can unlock progressively harder difficulties, making the game increasingly more brutal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><h4 id="Slay-the-Spire"><a href="#Slay-the-Spire" class="headerlink" title="Slay the Spire"></a>Slay the Spire</h4><p>One of the most highly praised indie games, MegaCrit’s <em>Slay the Spire</em> is a shining example of a perfect blend of genres. It’s a deckbuilding card game where you must climb the titular Spire while defeating enemies and bosses in turn-based card battles, so you can ultimately slay its heart. Each run consists of 3 Acts, each of which gives you choices of pathways that are procedurally generated. While enemy placement is somewhat controlled at first, it becomes more truly random the higher you climb. What makes StS particularly challenging is that it affords very few options to restore health so guarding your HP is vital. While death does mean you’ll have to start all the way from the bottom, you can unlock new cards for each of the game’s 4 classes as you level them up. The game also offers a wide variety of options for challenges and seeded custom runs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><h4 id="Hades"><a href="#Hades" class="headerlink" title="Hades"></a>Hades</h4><p>Nominated for a Game of the Year award, <em>Hades</em> is a beloved title that has converted many gamers to the roguelite genre. Your aim in the game, as the son of Hades, is to escape the Ancient Greek hell and ascend to the top of Olympus with the rest of the pantheon. The gameplay is fast-paced action hack-and-slash but it’s in a top-down perspective which makes it feel a lot closer to <em>Rogue</em> than other games in the genre. It also has a lot of elements that are randomized, including the location of helpful shops. Your build will also feel wildly different between runs as even the Gods that appear to power you up are random as well as the abilities they offer you to choose from.</p><p><img

The star of the most-followed channel on Twitch makes more than $560,000 a month streaming. If you are looking to get in on the action you need to pick up the best gaming <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >webcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your budget. However, there is a lot to consider before choosing your camera.</p><p>This guide critiques and ranks the best gaming webcams to make that choice easier. Some webcams provide great value, while others deliver an unbelievable high-resolution streaming experience. The following are some of the features we looked for in creating this guide:</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in Gaming Webcams"></a>What to Look for in Gaming Webcams</h2><ul><li>Video quality</li><li>Resolution</li><li>Microphone quality</li><li>Price</li><li>Low-light capabilities</li></ul><h2 id="Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have"><a href="#Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have" class="headerlink" title="Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have"></a>Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have</h2><ul><li>1080p resolution</li><li>60FPS</li><li>Stereo Audio</li><li>Ergonomic design</li><li>RealSense capabilities</li><li>Automatic light correction</li><li>Compatibility with both Windows and Mac</li></ul><p>So, without further ado, the following are our 5 favorite webcams for gaming in 2021:</p><h4 id="1-Ontop-HD-Webcam"><a href="#1-Ontop-HD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="1. Ontop+ HD Webcam"></a>1. Ontop+ HD Webcam</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ontop-webcam.jpg"                      alt="Ontop Webcam "                ></p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Microphones-Facial-enhancement-Technology-Recording-Streaming/dp/B074D2K7CZ" >Ontop+ HD Webcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a fantastic entry-level camera. It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO" class="headerlink" title="2.

Logitech BRIO</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-brio-4k-webcam.jpg"                      alt="Logitech Brio 4K Webcam "                ></p><p>The Logitech BRIO is the best high-end webcam for streaming. It delivers tremendous <strong>4K Ultra HD recording</strong>, allowing streamers to produce professional-quality videos. The BRIO is capable of shooting in 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 FPS (Ultra HD), 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 FPS (Full HD) and 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 FPS (HD).</p><p>The BRIO is also packed with additional features such as <strong>5x digital zoom</strong>, <strong>facial recognition</strong> and <strong>omnidirectional mics</strong>. It also supports <strong>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.</p><p>For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>4K Ultra HD recording</li><li>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</li><li>Fantastic audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>Compatibility</li></ul><h4 id="3-Razer-Kiyo"><a href="#3-Razer-Kiyo" class="headerlink" title="3.

The <strong>ring-light camera</strong> is a new feature, with twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens. Plus, the Razer Kiyo lets you adjust the brightness of the ring-light camera, with <strong>12 different brightness settings,</strong> so that you can always get the most flattering light. Although the Kiyo doesn’t come with much else. There’s no facial enhancement technology or background replacement.</p><p>What it does excel at is creating a vivid stream with high resolution. It is capable of shooting <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD)</strong> like a lot of its competitors. But we are convinced gamers will love the great lighting features that are unique to this style of streaming webcam. The camera was created after consultation with Twitch streamers and it also comes with built-in support for Xsplit and Open Broadcaster Software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Built-in Ring Light</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Built for Twitch streamers</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>No additional features</li><li>Cost</li></ul><h4 id="4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam"><a href="#4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="4.

With <strong>1080p full HD video at 30 FPS</strong>, on a <strong>2-megapixel base</strong> and <strong>built-in stereo microphones</strong>, this webcam keeps up with its main competitors and delivers a high-resolution image.</p><p>What we love about it though is its ease of use. This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has <strong>no additional software to install</strong>, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.</p><p>Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream. The Aukey also does not autofocus as well as other cameras on this list. But with a discount on Amazon, this is an excellent camera for beginners.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Cost</li><li>Ease of use</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>No lighting correction features</li><li>No 60 FPS streaming</li></ul><h4 id="5-Razer-Stargazer"><a href="#5-Razer-Stargazer" class="headerlink" title="5. Razer Stargazer"></a>5. Razer Stargazer</h4><p>The Razer Stargazer is the best webcam at effortless background removal. It is the only external webcam with an <strong>Intel RealSense 3D camera</strong>, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.</p><p>However, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?_ga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897" >Intel RealSense camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it’s <strong>fantastic at filtering out ambient noise</strong>.</p><p>If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M" >only $150 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Incredible background removal technology</li><li>Great audio</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Not as good video quality as some of its competitors</li><li>Not compatible with older generation computers</li></ul><p>Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, seem to be choosing Logitech cameras most often.
