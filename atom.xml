There are so many reasons why you may want video frame capture.</p><p>For Mac users, there are quite a few solutions for video frame capture. Let us explore the top five video frame capture software for Mac.</p><h2 id="Easy-to-use-video-frame-captures-for-mac"><a href="#Easy-to-use-video-frame-captures-for-mac" class="headerlink" title="Easy-to-use video frame captures for mac"></a>Easy-to-use video frame captures for mac</h2><p><a href="#p1">1.Wondershare Filmora [Step by Step Guide][Free]</a><br><a href="#p2">2.QuickTime Player [Free]</a><br><a href="#p3">3.ScreenFlow [Paid]</a><br><a href="#p4">4.Snagit [Paid]</a><br><a href="#p5">5.Monosnap [Free]</a></p><h3 id="1-Video-Frame-Capture-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Video-Frame-Capture-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Frame Capture: Wondershare Filmora"></a>1. Video Frame Capture: Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora (the Latest Filmora version X) is one of the finest software to use for video frame capture. It has a very easy interface for an amateur.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><ul><li>You can capture video frames from any format, like AVI, MPEG, WAV, DAT, EVO and many others.</li><li>You can capture frames and edit them directly.</li><li>You can export the captured and edited frames to YouTube, Vimeo, DVD and other devices or platforms without breaking a sweat.</li></ul><h4 id="Here-I’d-like-to-show-you-how-to-capture-frames-from-video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-on-Mac"><a href="#Here-I’d-like-to-show-you-how-to-capture-frames-from-video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Here I’d like to show you how to capture frames from video with Wondershare Filmora on Mac"></a>Here I’d like to show you how to capture frames from video with Wondershare Filmora on Mac</h4><h6 id="Step1-Simply-import-media-files"><a href="#Step1-Simply-import-media-files" class="headerlink" title="Step1: Simply import media files"></a>Step1: Simply import media files</h6><p>After launching Filmora, click <strong>New Project</strong> in the starting interface to create a new project and enter the main interface to import media clips. Click <strong>Import</strong> menu or the big “Import Media Files Here” menu to import the clips from Mac to Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-mac-import-videos.jpg"                      alt="frame captures for mac"                ></p><h6 id="Step2-Drag-and-drop-the-video-in-the-timeline-and-play-the-video-clip"><a href="#Step2-Drag-and-drop-the-video-in-the-timeline-and-play-the-video-clip" class="headerlink" title="Step2: Drag and drop the video in the timeline and play the video clip"></a>Step2: Drag and drop the video in the timeline and play the video clip</h6><p>Now, you can just drag the video clip in the media library to the timeline. Filmora supports fully Integrated 4K editing, so if your footage is 4K and your Mac has a good performance, we recommend you to adjust the <strong>playback quality</strong> to Full to get a clear snapshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-drag-and-drop-to-timeline.jpg"                      alt="capture video frames load clip in timeline"                ></p><p>To adjust the Playback Quality settings, just click the display icon under the preview window and then select <strong>Playback Quality</strong> option to select the best quality that you need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-playback-quality-settings.jpg"                      alt="Filmora 9 for Mac Playbak quality control"                ></p><h6 id="Step-3-Take-snapshot"><a href="#Step-3-Take-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Take snapshot"></a>Step 3: Take snapshot</h6><p>Click the icon “Snapshot”, which is under the right side of the screen within the interface. The frames will be immediately and automatically saved in Filmora Media Library.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-mac-take-snapshot.jpg"                      alt="Filmora 9 for Mac snapshot"                ></p><h6 id="Step-4-Locate-the-files"><a href="#Step-4-Locate-the-files" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Locate the files"></a>Step 4: Locate the files</h6><p>To access the captured frame snapshot, just right-click the snapshot in the media library and then select <strong>Reveal in Finder</strong>, you will find it is saved in the Snapshot folders directly. You can also edit the frames as you like to make them more relevant or to convey any message you want with some text and elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-mac-find-snapshot.jpg"                      alt="Filmora 9 for Mac snapshot"                ></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is the easiest and the most compatible software for video frame capture, given the multiple formats you would have to deal with and given the features you have on your Mac. Also, you need some software that would get you the frames and not a hazy or impromptu screenshot. Those are always subpar in quality and there can be significant generation loss.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>If you want to record a game or a video, you should not miss our <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Screen Recorders for All Purposes and All Platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Video-Frame-Capture-QuickTime-Player-Free"><a href="#2-Video-Frame-Capture-QuickTime-Player-Free" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Frame Capture: QuickTime Player [Free]"></a>2. Video Frame Capture: QuickTime Player [Free]</h3><p>You can consider QuickTime Player. It is available for free on Mac. It is the default application in Apple devices, particularly the Mac. You can record whatever’s on screen. You can also record the audio by using the microphone. You can record the full screen or a part of the screen. The instructions are easy and you can also use the camera on the Mac to capture external video using the application.</p><p>However, QuickTime Player is not ideal for screen grabs and editing or other processes are quite complicated. This is not the best solution for video frame capture.</p><p>Check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 popular ways for taking screenshot on Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="3-Video-Frame-Capture-ScreenFlow-99"><a href="#3-Video-Frame-Capture-ScreenFlow-99" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Frame Capture: ScreenFlow ($99)"></a>3. Video Frame Capture: ScreenFlow ($99)</h3><p>You can try ScreenFlow. It costs $99. You can not only initiate video frame capture but can also grab a screenshot of anything that’s on your desktop. You can zoom and crop what you have captured. There are some special features like callouts and annotations. The ScreenFlow app that is now available works in sync with iPhoto and iTunes.</p><p>The trouble is that much free software offers the same features as ScreenFlow so spending a hundred bucks doesn’t make sense.</p><h3 id="4-Video-Frame-Capture-Snagit-25"><a href="#4-Video-Frame-Capture-Snagit-25" class="headerlink" title="4. Video Frame Capture: Snagit ($25)"></a>4. Video Frame Capture: Snagit ($25)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snagit-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt="Snagit snapshot"                ></p><p>Snagit is another paid solution. It costs $25. It is not for amateurs. Capturing a screenshot is relatively simple and you also get features to help you insert the screenshot into articles or blog posts. But the interface is a little messy. In an attempt to make raw footage or captured frames readily accessible, the software really crowds up the tray. Also, despite being a paid solution it doesn’t have features to help you add connotations or titles.</p><h3 id="5-Video-Frame-Capture-Monosnap-Free"><a href="#5-Video-Frame-Capture-Monosnap-Free" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Frame Capture: Monosnap [Free]"></a>5. Video Frame Capture: Monosnap [Free]</h3><p>This is a free solution. It works better with short videos and quick snapshots. It is light, easy to use and it can work in sync with the integrated camera and microphone of your Mac. You can use your cloud storage to keep your screenshots or captured frames. Where Monosnap falters is the edit suite. There are very few edit features. All you can do is crop the frame you have captured. You cannot really hone your edit skills with this solution.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Besides taking screenshots in Filmora, you can also record the screen activities including gameplay as well. You can also add some effects, filter, overlays, transitions, elements, text and titles and audio to the screen video to make it better understood.<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Download Filmora now and have a try. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-recording-wonders-lightweight-win-11-edition/"><u>[New] Recording Wonders  Lightweight Win 11 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/perfecting-live-footage-with-fbx-recorder-for-2024/"><u>Perfecting Live Footage with FBX Recorder for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-capturing-android-sounds-without-root-access-guide/"><u>In 2024, Capturing Android Sounds Without Root Access [Guide]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-truescreenpro-windows-10s-choice/"><u>[New] In 2024, TrueScreenPro  Windows 10'S Choice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-ranking-the-best-mac-recording-alternatives-to-bandicam/"><u>In 2024, Ranking the Best Mac Recording Alternatives to Bandicam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-roguelike-rankings-the-best-10-games/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultimate Roguelike Rankings  The Best 10 Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-web-surfing-on-film-the-best-screen-recording-apps-of-today-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Web Surfing on Film  The Best Screen Recording Apps of Today for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-flawlessly-capture-your-ios-devices-screen-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Flawlessly Capture Your iOS Device's Screen for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-how-to-allocate-more-ram-to-minecraft-3-methods-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Allocate More Ram to Minecraft   3 Methods for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-the-secrets-of-memetic-success-through-gifs/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking the Secrets of Memetic Success Through GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-id-is-greyed-out-on-iphone-xs-how-to-bypass-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Apple ID is Greyed Out On iPhone XS How to Bypass?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-affluent-streaming-stars/"><u>2024 Approved  Affluent Streaming Stars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-alchemy-of-animation-in-snapchat-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  The Alchemy of Animation in Snapchat Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-visual-perfection-in-videos-implementing-black-bar-and-box-on-fb-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Visual Perfection in Videos  Implementing Black Bar & Box on FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/invisible-snapshotting-hidden-image-recording-on-snapchat-for-2024/"><u>Invisible Snapshotting  Hidden Image Recording on Snapchat for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

The workplace communication needs are evolving significantly and every one of us, individuals, companies, and organizations need to adapt promptly to the new ways of collaborating. Advanced technologies have now made it possible to <strong>make a group chat</strong> with family, friends, school, and coworkers to constantly stay updated with the latest family happenings or the progress of a particular project you’re working on. <strong>Skype group chat</strong> allows you to swiftly send messages, videos, pictures, etc. to multiple people at once while constantly apprising the group members of the latest events and developments.

However, today Skype group chat makes it possible for anyone to connect and collaborate with several people without any barriers and limitations.</p><p>To make a group chat on Skype using a Windows operating system you can get connected with individuals from diverse localities of the world within a minute. To make a Skype group chat for yourself follow along with the steps below.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.skype.com/"><strong>Download Skype</strong></a> on your Windows PC. You’ll need to sign in with a Microsoft account or sign up if you haven’t already had a Skype account.</li><li>Once you’ve logged in to Skype you’ll be presented with a similar interface with “Recent Chats” showing up in the left pane. To make a group chat click on the drop-down icon next to the “New Chat” button and select “New Group Chat” and your new Skype group chat is only a few clicks away.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-group-chat1.jpg"                      alt="new group chat"                ></p><ul><li>A new window will appear in the Skype main screen.

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

Related FAQs of iPad Timelapse"></a>Part 2. Related FAQs of iPad Timelapse</h2><p><strong>How long can iPad record time-lapse?</strong></p><p>Apple claims that iPad can record 30 hours of time-lapse video. You have to consider the battery charge and the storage space on your iPad. These important factors can limit the recording duration of your time-lapse video. The longer the duration of the time-lapse, the lower will be the frame rate.</p><p><strong>How do you time a video on iPad?</strong></p><p>You cannot set a fixed time duration for capturing a video on iPad. You have to manually start and stop recording a video on iPad. However, you can always trim the video duration as per your requirements. You can use iMovie app to trim the video duration and time your video accordingly.</p><p><strong>Can you turn a regular video into a timelapse?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can turn a regular video into a timelapse video easily on iPhone and iPad. You can use iMovie app that comes pre-installed. Otherwise, you can install it from App Store. Besides, you can use any timelapse app such as Lapse-It and SpeedPro to turn your regular video into a timelapse video.</p><p><strong>How long is a 1 hour time lapse on iPhone?</strong></p><p>When the recording duration is one hour in timelapse mode, iPhone frame capture rate is 1 frame per second. This means a 1-hour time lapse on iPhone will be 4 minutes. The calculation is that you have to divide the recording duration in seconds by one frame capture duration in seconds. In this case, you need to divide 3600 seconds by 4 seconds. This comes to 240 seconds which is 4 minutes.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>There is no doubt that taking a timelapse video with iPhone is a cakewalk However, if you own an iPad, you can capture stunning timelapse videos as well.

In addition, developers are continually innovating their programs to make your document processing easier. For example, you can now use google translate voice to text when you are typing a document for a diverse audience.</p><p>Below is a full guide on how to translate speech to text the right way with Google Translate. In addition, you will discover alternatives to google speech translate, including their summary and how they compare to one another.</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate"><a href="#Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?"></a>Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-1.jpg"                      alt="translate speech"                ></p><p>Google Translate is one of the easiest voice typing apps to use. However, before you go through the steps on how to use Google speech translate, here are a few points you need to consider:</p><ul><li>You need to have an external microphone to use google speech translate. Laptop and notebook owners can rely on their in-built microphone, and desktop users will need an external one. In addition, using a headset has better results than an external microphone.</li><li>Ensure you allow google translate voice to text to access your device’s microphone. You will find your microphone settings in the <strong>Control Panel</strong> for Windows and <strong>Preferences</strong> if you are a Mac user.</li><li>Unfortunately, you cannot upload audio files to Google speech translate. In addition, there is no information if subsequent updates of the app will include the feature.</li><li>Regarding Google speech to text pricing, the app is free to download and use. Although the service is available from the web browser, having an active Google account enables you to access its full features.</li><li>Although Google translate voice to text can detect your language, it does suffer accuracy issues occasionally. Therefore, confirm that you select the correct language before using the translation service.</li></ul><p>The above points apply to all versions of Google speech translate, whether on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Now that you are aware of the app’s key user points, here is how you can translate speech to text with Google Translate:</p><p>1. Launch the app from your device’s home screen or the installation directory for computer users.</p><p>2. Select the languages you want to translate from the main screen using the arrow buttons on the bottom right corner of each box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-2.jpg"                      alt="arrow buttons"                ></p><p>For example, if you want to translate English to French, English will appear in the first box and French in the other. Kindly note that the app does not detect microphone input automatically. The feature is only available for typed text.</p><p>3. Proceed to the bottom of the page and click the Microphone button to begin translating your speech to text input. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for best results.</p><p>4. You can end your recording by clicking the Stop button.</p><p>5. You can listen to your translation by clicking the Listen button from the right box of Google speech translate. In addition, you can switch between playback speeds by pressing the Listen button repeatedly.</p><h2 id="Part2-How-to-translate-recorded-speeches-with-Google-Translate"><a href="#Part2-How-to-translate-recorded-speeches-with-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Part2: How to translate recorded speeches with Google Translate?"></a>Part2: How to translate recorded speeches with Google Translate?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Google Translate does not support the translation of audio file uploads, such as recorded speeches and music files. The service only supports translation of the following file types;</p><ul><li>Docx</li><li>Pdf</li><li>Pptx</li><li>Xlsx</li></ul><p>It also allows you to translate websites in your browser automatically. Here is how to translate websites with Google Translate:</p><ol><li>Click on the Websites tab from the app’s home page.</li><li>Select the original language as Detect Language because the app refers to its over 100-language library to determine the source language. Inputting the wrong source language will result in an incorrect translation.</li><li>Type the URL you need to translate in the Website textbox and click Go to view the website in your preferred language.</li></ol><p>So, how can you translate recorded audio using Google Translate? Follow the below steps:</p><h3 id="Use-other-transcribe-tools-to-transcript-the-audio"><a href="#Use-other-transcribe-tools-to-transcript-the-audio" class="headerlink" title="Use other transcribe tools to transcript the audio"></a>Use other transcribe tools to transcript the audio</h3><p>As earlier mentioned, you can only use Google Translate with text documents and websites. As such, you need to transcribe the recorded speech using a different transcription app, then upload the transcript to Google Translate. The compatible file formats are .docx, .pdf, .pptx, and .xlsx.</p><p>Some of the transcribing apps you can use include, Trint, Rev, and Happy Scribe. In addition, check if the apps require you to purchase a subscription before using them. Although some apps offer free trials, your access may have feature limitations. For example, most apps limit transcription of recorded audio files to between five and sixty minutes, depending on the developer.</p><h3 id="Paste-to-Google-translate"><a href="#Paste-to-Google-translate" class="headerlink" title="Paste to Google translate"></a>Paste to Google translate</h3><p>Once you finish transcribing the speech recording from the third-party app, ensure you save it in the file formats indicated above. You will then follow the below steps to finish translating your speech recording.</p><ol><li>Launch Google Translate on your device.</li><li>Tap the Documents tab from the app’s home screen.</li><li>Select the Detect Language option for the left box, and choose your desired translation language for the right box. Typically, the app lists English, Spanish, and Arabic as the default language options. However, you will find additional languages by clicking the down arrow on the right. Google Translate has over 100 languages in its internal library, including Xhosa and Latin. Despite this, you should always check the translation accuracy before submitting your work.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="OBS-vs-ShadowPlay-The-Ultimate-Showdown-for-Gamers"><a href="#OBS-vs-ShadowPlay-The-Ultimate-Showdown-for-Gamers" class="headerlink" title="OBS vs ShadowPlay: The Ultimate Showdown for Gamers"></a>OBS vs ShadowPlay: The Ultimate Showdown for Gamers</h2><p>If you are an avid gamer and you are not recording your gameplay and uploading on online platforms, you are missing out on the trend. Gamers are uploading their gameplay on video streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube and earning followers, fame as well as money. No matter which game you play on your computer, you should record it. Thereafter, you can make it interesting with editing and voiceover and upload on video streaming and social media platforms.</p><p>Primarily, you will need a gameplay recording software and there is no dearth of gameplay and screen recording software. The two most popular free gameplay recorders are OBS Studio and ShadowPlay. In order to help you choose OBS or ShadowPlay, we have provided you with a complete comparison of ShadowPlay vs OBS recording software. Go through all the points minutely and understand their differences and pick the perfect one for recording your gameplay.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-Features-of-OBS-and-ShadowPlay"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Features-of-OBS-and-ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Key Features of OBS and ShadowPlay"></a>Part 1. Key Features of OBS and ShadowPlay</h2><p>OBS and ShadowPlay are both completely free to use for recording your gameplay as well as your capturing desktop screen. OBS is open-source software and it has a cross-platform structure which is why it supports all computer operating systems. It is popular among gamers for live streaming on Twitch and YouTube.</p><p>ShadowPlay comes from Nvidia which is the largest manufacturer for GPU. That is why gamers who prefer Nvidia GPU, they have a special preference for ShadowPlay. Here are the key features of OBS and ShadowPlay you should be aware of.</p><h3 id="OBS-Studio"><a href="#OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="OBS Studio"></a>OBS Studio</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-sims4-obs.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Screen Capture</strong> - You can capture high-quality gameplay when you play games on your computer as well as on a gaming console. You can tweak the parameters on video quality so that you can get the recording just like you want.</p><p><strong>Webcam Capture</strong> - OBS lets you add webcam as an overlay so that you can record your gameplay as well as show your reaction so that the recording is more interactive and engaging. You can also use green screen setup to make the video more professional and eye-catching.</p><p><strong>Better Audio</strong> - You can record your game sound as well as your voice from external mic. This is useful for voiceover and live commentary to make the video interesting and showcase your personality traits verbally. There are also audio filters, audio mixers, and audio effects available to apply.</p><p><strong>Advanced Editor</strong> - The built-in editing software allows performing different post-recording tasks like sharpening, cropping, and color correction. It has advanced filters that enable Chroma keying, image masking, and color correction.</p><p><strong>Easy Switching</strong> - It comes with a one-click solution for switching between transitions and scenes. The tool can be perfect for going back and forth between games and devices. You can also add multiple screens and audio sources as required.</p><p>Most importantly, you can live stream your gameplay on almost any online video streaming platform.</p><h3 id="Nvidia-ShadowPlay"><a href="#Nvidia-ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="Nvidia ShadowPlay"></a>Nvidia ShadowPlay</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="shadowplay"                ></p><p><strong>Gameplay Capture</strong> - ShadowPlay lets you record gameplay at 8K with 30FPS. This is unmatched by any free video recording software. You can also record gameplay at 4K HDR with 60FPS. It comes with hardware acceleration to ensure the performance does not get affected while recording in the background.</p><p><strong>Instant Replay</strong> - ShadowPlay keeps recording in the background and therefore, if something important has happened in the game, you can get the last 30 seconds of instant replay clip and you can share it anywhere you want. This is highly useful to share short clips on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay Highlights</strong> - The feature will automatically record the best gaming moments and create a perfect highlight video. This is useful when you want to upload the best parts of the gameplay rather than the entire part.</p><p><strong>Screenshots</strong> - ShadowPlay lets you capture 8K screenshots of your game that you can use as thumbnails for your videos as well as put them up on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>GIF Creator</strong> - With ShadowPlay, you don’t have to leave the game to create GIFs. You can create high-quality GIFs of duration 15 seconds. You can also add text to the GIFs and share anything you want.</p><p>Just like OBS, ShadowPlay enables you to broadcast gameplay in real-time on YouTube Live, Twitch, and Facebook Live.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS"></a>Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS</h2><p>Here are the key points of differences between OBS and ShadowPlay that will help you decide between OBS or ShadowPlay.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS</strong> <strong>Recording:</strong></p><p>While recording, OBS allows faster processing of the recorded video files. Besides, it can compress the file size during the encoding process so that the recorded video files take relatively less space. This makes it ideal for longer sessions of gameplay recording. However, in the process, OBS can reduce the frame rate significantly, and hence, the video may not be as smooth as you expect it to be. Therefore, OBS is suitable for regular game recording where not much compression is required.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay does not reduce the file size or frame rate, and hence, it is a great choice for high-end games where you need the recorded to be as smooth as possible. However, ShadowPlay requires more space on the hard drive. When you upload on video streaming platforms, there will be some automatic compression. Therefore, the less compression you do during your encoding phase, the better will be the output.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Performance:</strong></p><p>OBS uses significant CPU power and resources. This is one of the reasons why it reduces the frame rate while recording to use less CPU resources. In fact, it can affect the game performance if you are playing and recording a high-end game. However, you can customize various configuration parameters to reduce its burden on CPU performance.</p><p>ShadowPlay does not affect the CPU performance as it comes with hardware acceleration. It supports higher frame rates for high-end games as well. If at all, it can bring about 5%-10% effect on CPU performance which is almost ignorable in comparison to OBS.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS File Format</strong>:</p><p>OBS consumes less space for recorded videos. It compresses the format which can drastically reduce the output file size. The best thing about OBS is that it comes with the NVENC hardware encoded chip that allows choosing from different supported file formats.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay supports MP4 formats by default which makes it require more space. It uses  codec. MP4 file format is the most popular video file format that you can play across all media players and upload on online platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>You cannot live stream as well as record on ShadowPlay. This is a major drawback that OBS has overcome. That is why most gamers prefer OBS Studio for live streaming as they can record the gaming session for future reference. If you want to just broadcast your gameplay, ShadowPlay is good enough. But if you want to have multiple scenes and overlay adjustments in live streaming, OBS is the best choice.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Editing:</strong></p><p>OBS offers better editing options thanks to its built-in editor. Starting customizable transitions to real-time editing before broadcasting, OBS has different editing scopes tailor-made for gamers. On the contrary, ShadowPlay has very limited editing options as the main focus is on recording only. But if we talk about true video editing, both applications are still underdeveloped on this front.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Alternative Way To Record Games"></a>Part 3. Alternative Way To Record Games</h2><p>If you are looking for a premium gameplay recording software, we recommend Wondershare Filmora.

For not so high-end games, OBS does the job perfectly. OBS is particularly useful when you want to live stream as well as record your gameplay.

How to Record Games NVIDIA Screen Recorder"></a>Part 2. How to Record Games NVIDIA Screen Recorder</h2><p>NVIDIA ShadowPlay comes under NVIDIA GeForce recording option. This means you cannot open ShadowPlay directly, and you have to open it via GeForce Experience. Therefore, you need to have GeForce Experience installed on your phone. Apart from ShadowPlay, you get a direct game streaming option, instant game settings optimization and NVIDIA graphics card updates under GeForce Experience. Here are the steps to follow to use NVIDIA record screen software to record gameplay.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install GeForce Experience from NVIDIA official website. Launch GeForce Experience from Windows Start menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-overlay.jpg"                      alt="run nvidia shadowplay"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once GeForce Experience opens, you have to click on the Share button at the top-right corner.

Such a dip is negligible if you have a high-performance gaming computer.</p><p>However, the dip could be significant if your computer does not have a high configuration. In that case, the gameplay can get slightly slow and lag at times. In a fair comparison, NVIDIA GeForce recording may take slightly more system resources than most screen recording software. This means no matter which screen recorder you use, there will always be some dip in the performance of the game, and you should learn to neglect it.</p><p>NVIDIA record gameplay software is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Real-Time-Recorder-Battle-Go-OBS-Vs-ShadowPlay"><a href="#Real-Time-Recorder-Battle-Go-OBS-Vs-ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="Real-Time Recorder Battle: Go OBS! Vs. ShadowPlay"></a>Real-Time Recorder Battle: Go OBS! Vs. ShadowPlay</h2><p>If you are an avid gamer and you are not recording your gameplay and uploading on online platforms, you are missing out on the trend. Gamers are uploading their gameplay on video streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube and earning followers, fame as well as money. No matter which game you play on your computer, you should record it. Thereafter, you can make it interesting with editing and voiceover and upload on video streaming and social media platforms.</p><p>Primarily, you will need a gameplay recording software and there is no dearth of gameplay and screen recording software. The two most popular free gameplay recorders are OBS Studio and ShadowPlay. In order to help you choose OBS or ShadowPlay, we have provided you with a complete comparison of ShadowPlay vs OBS recording software. Go through all the points minutely and understand their differences and pick the perfect one for recording your gameplay.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-Features-of-OBS-and-ShadowPlay"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Features-of-OBS-and-ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Key Features of OBS and ShadowPlay"></a>Part 1. Key Features of OBS and ShadowPlay</h2><p>OBS and ShadowPlay are both completely free to use for recording your gameplay as well as your capturing desktop screen. OBS is open-source software and it has a cross-platform structure which is why it supports all computer operating systems. It is popular among gamers for live streaming on Twitch and YouTube.</p><p>ShadowPlay comes from Nvidia which is the largest manufacturer for GPU. That is why gamers who prefer Nvidia GPU, they have a special preference for ShadowPlay. Here are the key features of OBS and ShadowPlay you should be aware of.</p><h3 id="OBS-Studio"><a href="#OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="OBS Studio"></a>OBS Studio</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-sims4-obs.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Screen Capture</strong> - You can capture high-quality gameplay when you play games on your computer as well as on a gaming console. You can tweak the parameters on video quality so that you can get the recording just like you want.</p><p><strong>Webcam Capture</strong> - OBS lets you add webcam as an overlay so that you can record your gameplay as well as show your reaction so that the recording is more interactive and engaging. You can also use green screen setup to make the video more professional and eye-catching.</p><p><strong>Better Audio</strong> - You can record your game sound as well as your voice from external mic. This is useful for voiceover and live commentary to make the video interesting and showcase your personality traits verbally. There are also audio filters, audio mixers, and audio effects available to apply.</p><p><strong>Advanced Editor</strong> - The built-in editing software allows performing different post-recording tasks like sharpening, cropping, and color correction. It has advanced filters that enable Chroma keying, image masking, and color correction.</p><p><strong>Easy Switching</strong> - It comes with a one-click solution for switching between transitions and scenes. The tool can be perfect for going back and forth between games and devices. You can also add multiple screens and audio sources as required.</p><p>Most importantly, you can live stream your gameplay on almost any online video streaming platform.</p><h3 id="Nvidia-ShadowPlay"><a href="#Nvidia-ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="Nvidia ShadowPlay"></a>Nvidia ShadowPlay</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="shadowplay"                ></p><p><strong>Gameplay Capture</strong> - ShadowPlay lets you record gameplay at 8K with 30FPS. This is unmatched by any free video recording software. You can also record gameplay at 4K HDR with 60FPS. It comes with hardware acceleration to ensure the performance does not get affected while recording in the background.</p><p><strong>Instant Replay</strong> - ShadowPlay keeps recording in the background and therefore, if something important has happened in the game, you can get the last 30 seconds of instant replay clip and you can share it anywhere you want. This is highly useful to share short clips on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay Highlights</strong> - The feature will automatically record the best gaming moments and create a perfect highlight video. This is useful when you want to upload the best parts of the gameplay rather than the entire part.</p><p><strong>Screenshots</strong> - ShadowPlay lets you capture 8K screenshots of your game that you can use as thumbnails for your videos as well as put them up on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>GIF Creator</strong> - With ShadowPlay, you don’t have to leave the game to create GIFs. You can create high-quality GIFs of duration 15 seconds. You can also add text to the GIFs and share anything you want.</p><p>Just like OBS, ShadowPlay enables you to broadcast gameplay in real-time on YouTube Live, Twitch, and Facebook Live.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS"></a>Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS</h2><p>Here are the key points of differences between OBS and ShadowPlay that will help you decide between OBS or ShadowPlay.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS</strong> <strong>Recording:</strong></p><p>While recording, OBS allows faster processing of the recorded video files. Besides, it can compress the file size during the encoding process so that the recorded video files take relatively less space. This makes it ideal for longer sessions of gameplay recording. However, in the process, OBS can reduce the frame rate significantly, and hence, the video may not be as smooth as you expect it to be. Therefore, OBS is suitable for regular game recording where not much compression is required.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay does not reduce the file size or frame rate, and hence, it is a great choice for high-end games where you need the recorded to be as smooth as possible. However, ShadowPlay requires more space on the hard drive. When you upload on video streaming platforms, there will be some automatic compression. Therefore, the less compression you do during your encoding phase, the better will be the output.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Performance:</strong></p><p>OBS uses significant CPU power and resources. This is one of the reasons why it reduces the frame rate while recording to use less CPU resources. In fact, it can affect the game performance if you are playing and recording a high-end game. However, you can customize various configuration parameters to reduce its burden on CPU performance.</p><p>ShadowPlay does not affect the CPU performance as it comes with hardware acceleration. It supports higher frame rates for high-end games as well. If at all, it can bring about 5%-10% effect on CPU performance which is almost ignorable in comparison to OBS.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS File Format</strong>:</p><p>OBS consumes less space for recorded videos. It compresses the format which can drastically reduce the output file size. The best thing about OBS is that it comes with the NVENC hardware encoded chip that allows choosing from different supported file formats.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay supports MP4 formats by default which makes it require more space. It uses  codec. MP4 file format is the most popular video file format that you can play across all media players and upload on online platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>You cannot live stream as well as record on ShadowPlay. This is a major drawback that OBS has overcome. That is why most gamers prefer OBS Studio for live streaming as they can record the gaming session for future reference. If you want to just broadcast your gameplay, ShadowPlay is good enough. But if you want to have multiple scenes and overlay adjustments in live streaming, OBS is the best choice.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Editing:</strong></p><p>OBS offers better editing options thanks to its built-in editor. Starting customizable transitions to real-time editing before broadcasting, OBS has different editing scopes tailor-made for gamers. On the contrary, ShadowPlay has very limited editing options as the main focus is on recording only. But if we talk about true video editing, both applications are still underdeveloped on this front.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.
