The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus ‘+’ sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the outer by adding an ‘L’ shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle5.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle6.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle6"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft"><a href="#How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft" class="headerlink" title="How to make a Sphere in Minecraft"></a>How to make a Sphere in Minecraft</h2><p>The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now it’s time to create layers of the sphere. To do that you have to create a layer of 7 blocks wide on the top and the bottom of the column.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857865/11832" target="_top" id="857865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857865/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Since you have created the 1st and the 16th levels of the sphere, now you have to follow this procedure for all remaining layers: Make a layer of 11 blocks for the 2nd and 15th levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1912746">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1912746">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmindmanager.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1912746%2F20231'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1912746/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Follow the same pattern throughout the levels: 13 blocks layer on 3rd and 14th level, 15 blocks on 4th and 13th levels, 17 blocks on 5th and 12th level, and so on. As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks. Follow this process until you reach the middle of the column.</p><p>These circles and spheres are useful in Minecraft and they play a very vital role in building your own world in Minecraft. They can be very beneficial while creating buildings, houses, and more places. These can be used as curves to give your buildings an aesthetic look and feel. But this whole process needs practice and efforts to master it and use it for your own purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><hr><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Creating such amazing things and sharing them on your social media and video sharing platforms can get you a lot of audience and views.

You can record the full screen or a part of the screen. The instructions are easy and you can also use the camera on the Mac to capture external video using the application.</p><p>However, QuickTime Player is not ideal for screen grabs and editing or other processes are quite complicated.

You can not only initiate video frame capture but can also grab a screenshot of anything that’s on your desktop. You can zoom and crop what you have captured. There are some special features like callouts and annotations. The ScreenFlow app that is now available works in sync with iPhoto and iTunes.</p><p>The trouble is that much free software offers the same features as ScreenFlow so spending a hundred bucks doesn’t make sense.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137208/26400" target="_top" id="2137208">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137208" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137208/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Video-Frame-Capture-Snagit-25"><a href="#4-Video-Frame-Capture-Snagit-25" class="headerlink" title="4.

It costs $25. It is not for amateurs. Capturing a screenshot is relatively simple and you also get features to help you insert the screenshot into articles or blog posts. But the interface is a little messy. In an attempt to make raw footage or captured frames readily accessible, the software really crowds up the tray. Also, despite being a paid solution it doesn’t have features to help you add connotations or titles.</p><h3 id="5-Video-Frame-Capture-Monosnap-Free"><a href="#5-Video-Frame-Capture-Monosnap-Free" class="headerlink" title="5.

It is light, easy to use and it can work in sync with the integrated camera and microphone of your Mac. You can use your cloud storage to keep your screenshots or captured frames. Where Monosnap falters is the edit suite. There are very few edit features. All you can do is crop the frame you have captured. You cannot really hone your edit skills with this solution.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151855/7443" target="_top" id="2151855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Besides taking screenshots in Filmora, you can also record the screen activities including gameplay as well.

About Bandicam</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bandicam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is specially designed for Windows PC users.

It lets you record from external sources like PlayStation, webcam, and smartphones. You can even add voice along with the system sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bandicam-screen-recorder-for-pc.jpg"                      alt="bandicam screen recorder"                ></p><p>It allows real-time drawing while recording. Bandicam also lets you add your webcam while recording the screen. You can schedule your recording. You can make use of the green screen technique as well. Besides, you can perform the basic editing after recording. In comparison to OBS, it is a highly user-friendly interface for easy operation.</p><p><strong>Recommended System Requirements</strong> <strong>-</strong></p><ul><li>Supported OS - Windows only.</li><li>Processor - Dual-core processor or higher.</li><li>RAM - 1 GB or more.</li><li>HDD - 1 GB or more</li><li>VGA - 800x600, 16 bit color.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam-3"><a href="#Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam"></a>Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam</h2><p>Here is a detailed comparison of OBS Studio and Bandicam that will definitely help you to which video recording software you should opt for.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong></p><p>The user interface is the main difference between the two popular recording applications. The user interface of OBS can be too overwhelming for a beginner. It takes considerable time to get used to and find the required options instantly. In fact, you may have to go through tutorial videos to get a proper grip on the software. Owning to the popularity of OBS Studio, there is no dearth of videos and guides on OBS.</p><p>On the contrary, Bandicam has a straightforward and user-friendly interface. This is one of the main reasons why some users ditch OBS and opt for Bandicam by paying the required price. You can get all the options intuitively and adjust all the parameters of video recording instantly. Even a beginner will feel like a pro while using Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Screen Recording:</strong></p><p>Both the applications are tailor-made for screen recording. In terms of settings and customizing parameters, both the applications have the same offering. However, when it comes to customized screen recording such as capturing a portion of the screen, the operation gets easy with Bandicam thanks to its intuitive controls and options.</p><p>Moreover, there are more options available for better screen recording on Bandicam. The mouse clicks are well highlighted, there are options for real-time drawing, and you can even schedule screen recording. Setting up a webcam along with the screen in addition to system and external audio recording is more convenient on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Game Recording</strong>:</p><p>There is a dedicated option available on Bandicam for game recording. This means setting up your screen and recording parameters is easy on Bandicam when it comes to game recording. On the contrary, there is no dedicated option on OBS and hence, it is the same as recording your screen with OBS. Therefore, in terms of options and easy controls for game recording, Bandicam is a clear winner.</p><p>However, for recording high-end games, you need a considerably high configuration computer for Bandicam. Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform. Therefore, if you are looking for a video recorder where you can live stream as well, Bandicam should not be your choice and you have to opt for OBS Studio.</p><p>OBS Studio is equally popular in the video creator community as a video recorder as well as a live streaming platform. It is hardly as software available like OBS from where you can live stream on so many different online platforms. Once you have the stream URL and stream key, you are good to go for live streaming from your desktop computer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135354/19272" target="_top" id="2135354">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135354" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135354/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Expert-OBS-Tutorial-for-Effective-Skype-Recording"><a href="#Expert-OBS-Tutorial-for-Effective-Skype-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Expert OBS Tutorial for Effective Skype Recording"></a>Expert OBS Tutorial for Effective Skype Recording</h2><p>Video interviews for remote jobs are quite common these days because of this quickening pace of the world around us. And these interviews are recorded to further evaluate the information exchanged, so for the recording of these videos certain tools have also been introduced in the market. I myself have used a few of them; and the most popular these days are easily zoom and skype. Both these programs offer clear communication among all concerned parties. The reason why I want to discuss skype here is that zoom’s video quality is an issue, it has got very low video quality and the audio, it records in one track so if you have made a mistake in the speaking or something audible, it will remain there.</p><p>So in this article I will discuss that how can you record your skype videos using OBS. Skype has been extensively used for quite a long time now and it hasn’t lost its edge over the years but has actually upgraded and improved its services with time. Coming to OBS which is an open-source software used widely for streaming purposes. It provides an incredible experience courtesy of its variety of editing and recording options. The audio can be recorded from the system and the microphone. And video can be fetched from the webcam. Along with the recording of specific section of the screen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS"></a>Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS</h2><p>To begin with shedding some light on the OBS program:</p><p>A little piece of software that can be used for both business and non-commercial purposes. Streaming on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook is supported. It has the ability to record the screen with cursor effects. It allows you to record your screen indefinitely. Watermarks aren’t added: the video doesn’t have any watermarks. There are options for multichannel, Multilanguage, and single channel.</p><p>Now to setup the environment for screen recording we have to follow the following steps.</p><p>Initially, you’ll be required to have skype installed on your desktop along with the up-to-date version of OBS software. After installing skype you first have to make a secondary&#x2F;backup account on skype. After that you require a secondary camera as well to record yourself because your webcam can be in demand elsewhere, so you would not be able to record yourself or even the guests wouldn’t be able to see you. And then turn on the given command in skype i-e: skype&gt;settings&gt;calling&gt;advanced&gt;’allow NDI usage’ as shown in the picture. This command allows OBS to access skype videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-calling-settings-advanced-calling.jpg"                      alt="skype calling settings advanced calling"                ></p><p>After this you have to open the OBS program and set it up for skype calls, firs thing is to create a new scene, then you’re going to hit the plus button and select the capture device. Now you can see yourself on camera and screen can easily be cropped, while holding ‘Alt’, on OBS so fix it according to your liking. Then press ‘lock’ using the NDI plug-in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-program-set-up-for-skype.jpg"                      alt="obs program set up for skype"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-vlc-videos-source.jpg"                      alt="obs vlc videos source"                ></p><p>To setup NDI plugin you have to visit <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases/tag/4.9.1" >https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases/tag/4.9.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and check for the compatible version with your operating system. On this website the plugin is available for windows, mac and Linux.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obc-ndi-plugin-visit.jpg"                      alt="obc ndi plugin visit"                ></p><p>And after addition of plug in you would want to click on ‘+’ again and select NDI plugin and you can select the source video which is going to be the received video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-additon-of-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="obs additon of plug in"                ></p><p>And clicking on it will open a new window where you have to select the guest feed, which will be possible once the call has begun. The call connected will appear on the NDI plugin window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-new-window-select-the-guest-feed.jpg"                      alt="obs new window select the guest feed"                ></p><p>As you receive the call from the reciever you will see the incoming feed of him as shown in the figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-receive-the-call.jpg"                      alt="obs receive the call"                ></p><p>So you can just resize it similarly as you did yours earlier and pressing the lock icon will stop you from mistakenly modify or change the video screen settings. Now to record the video you have to click on record button and your desktop starts recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-resize-it-similarly.jpg"                      alt="obs resize it similarly"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-OBS-Alternative-to-Record-Skype"><a href="#Part-2-OBS-Alternative-to-Record-Skype" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: OBS Alternative to Record Skype"></a>Part 2: OBS Alternative to Record Skype</h2><h3 id="Filmora"><a href="#Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Filmora is a very popular and perfect <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and editor designed by Wondershare.

There are options for changing the audio devices for your own computer. And I recommend that you separate your audio right now. Everything is set up in a way that everything’s going to come through one audio feed. I don’t like that. I think it’s better if you separate your audio that. Let’s say you cough during an interview or something. You’re actually able to cut that out and you can actually record a separate feed itself.</p><p><strong>Capturing Audio in OBS Studio on a Mac</strong></p><p>On a Mac, you’ll need to install an additional OBS plugin to capture audio.</p><ul><li>Install iShowU Audio Capture on your computer.</li><li>Make sure you navigate to Security &amp; Privacy in your System Preferences.</li><li>To proceed, you may need to grant permission to “Shiny White Box.”</li><li>Restart your Mac after the installation is complete.</li><li>Open Audio MIDI Setup after rebooting.</li><li>At the bottom left of the window, click the Plus button.</li><li>Select Create Multi-Output Device from the drop-down menu.</li></ul><p>So form the above discussion it can be concluded that OBS for screen recording can be a very handy tool because it has the ability to easily record skype videos along with separate audio recording to avoid interference of sounds and mix ups. The separate audio recording system allows us to manipulate and modify the sounds along with the video quality. Skype is a tool much used by the world for quite some time and it still continues to serve us with numerous improvements and updates to simplify the complex world of networking today and the tools to use it properly help us communicate better with others.
