This should make the headset work, but according to some users, this is only a temporary fix and you need to do the reconnection every time your computer restarts.</li><li><strong>Try a different USB port</strong> just in case the previous port you use is somehow broken or it can not provide enough power to your headset.</li></ul><p> If you go through the steps above but the problem persists, move on to the more complicated fixes below.</p><h3 id="Fix-2-–-Update-your-device-drivers"><a href="#Fix-2-–-Update-your-device-drivers" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2 – Update your device drivers"></a>Fix 2 – Update your device drivers</h3><p> The Oculus Rift S mic not working issue is likely to be driver-related. To keep your VR headset running in tip-top condition, you should update your device drivers on a regular basis.</p><p> You can search for the most recent driver from the website of your device manufacturer. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  .</p><p> Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.</p><p> You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Pro version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  it takes just 2 steps:</p><ol><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  and install Driver Easy.</li><li>Run Driver Easy and click the<strong>Scan Now</strong> button.

The good news is that you can share your screen and presentation without formal participation in the Google Meet session. The procedure is slightly different from the regular one. Let’s know more about how to share the screen on Google Meet without joining the meeting.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting"><a href="#Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting"></a>Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting</h3><p>Launch the Google Meet website or its application, enter the meeting code or link, or click <strong>start a meeting</strong>.</p><p>Click the Google Meet invite link and then you will see the screen as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/present-without-participant-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  "                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating"><a href="#Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Share screen without participating"></a>Step 2: Share screen without participating</h3><p>Tap <strong>Present</strong> and select a preferred window to share.

Alongside joining Google Meet, you may also share your screen in Firefox and Internet explorer. Similarly, Opera mini can be used as well to take advantage of the screen sharing feature.

However, it is not obvious that you only use Google Meet to participate in the discussion. There can be a situation when you don’t want to join a video session formally yet need to share a presentation. The good news is that you can share your screen and presentation without formal participation in the Google Meet session. The procedure is slightly different from the regular one. Let’s know more about how to share the screen on Google Meet without joining the meeting.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting-1"><a href="#Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting"></a>Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting</h3><p>Launch the Google Meet website or its application, enter the meeting code or link, or click <strong>start a meeting</strong>.</p><p>Click the Google Meet invite link and then you will see the screen as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/present-without-participant-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  "                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating-1"><a href="#Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Share screen without participating"></a>Step 2: Share screen without participating</h3><p>Tap <strong>Present</strong> and select a preferred window to share.

There is no exception for Google Meet. So, you can use all its features, and even access it through any other browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Alongside joining Google Meet, you may also share your screen in Firefox and Internet explorer. Similarly, Opera mini can be used as well to take advantage of the screen sharing feature. Although the process is almost the same as in Google Chrome, users may find a slightly different interface when joining through other browsers.

However, it is not obvious that you only use Google Meet to participate in the discussion. There can be a situation when you don’t want to join a video session formally yet need to share a presentation. The good news is that you can share your screen and presentation without formal participation in the Google Meet session. The procedure is slightly different from the regular one. Let’s know more about how to share the screen on Google Meet without joining the meeting.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting-3"><a href="#Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting"></a>Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting</h3><p>Launch the Google Meet website or its application, enter the meeting code or link, or click <strong>start a meeting</strong>.</p><p>Click the Google Meet invite link and then you will see the screen as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/present-without-participant-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  "                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating-3"><a href="#Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Share screen without participating"></a>Step 2: Share screen without participating</h3><p>Tap <strong>Present</strong> and select a preferred window to share.

Related FAQs of iPad Timelapse"></a>Part 2. Related FAQs of iPad Timelapse</h2><p><strong>How long can iPad record time-lapse?</strong></p><p>Apple claims that iPad can record 30 hours of time-lapse video. You have to consider the battery charge and the storage space on your iPad. These important factors can limit the recording duration of your time-lapse video. The longer the duration of the time-lapse, the lower will be the frame rate.</p><p><strong>How do you time a video on iPad?</strong></p><p>You cannot set a fixed time duration for capturing a video on iPad. You have to manually start and stop recording a video on iPad. However, you can always trim the video duration as per your requirements. You can use iMovie app to trim the video duration and time your video accordingly.</p><p><strong>Can you turn a regular video into a timelapse?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can turn a regular video into a timelapse video easily on iPhone and iPad. You can use iMovie app that comes pre-installed. Otherwise, you can install it from App Store. Besides, you can use any timelapse app such as Lapse-It and SpeedPro to turn your regular video into a timelapse video.</p><p><strong>How long is a 1 hour time lapse on iPhone?</strong></p><p>When the recording duration is one hour in timelapse mode, iPhone frame capture rate is 1 frame per second. This means a 1-hour time lapse on iPhone will be 4 minutes. The calculation is that you have to divide the recording duration in seconds by one frame capture duration in seconds. In this case, you need to divide 3600 seconds by 4 seconds. This comes to 240 seconds which is 4 minutes.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>There is no doubt that taking a timelapse video with iPhone is a cakewalk However, if you own an iPad, you can capture stunning timelapse videos as well.

However, Windows 10 offers a built-in tool that enables PC users to record all on-screen activities with a push of a button. Furthermore, this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screencasting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>tool allows you to <strong>capture screens and record webcam videos</strong> at the same time so that you can record the gameplay of the video games you play or create tutorials.</p><p>You are at the right place if you would like to learn how to record computer screens and webcam videos simultaneously because in this article we are going to show you several different ways in which you can perform this task on Windows 10.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Capture-Screens-and-Webcam-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Capture-Screens-and-Webcam-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Capture Screens and Webcam Videos with Filmora?"></a>Part 1: How to Capture Screens and Webcam Videos with Filmora?</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PC users have a variety of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recorders <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at their disposal that can either be used free of charge or for a small fee. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a video editing software that also offers screen capturing functionality, which enables you to record the webcam feed and computer screen at the same time.</p><p>Once you’ve installed Fimora on your PC, you should launch the app and create a new project. After Filmora’s main window loads, you should head over to the Media tab, and click on the Record drop-down menu that is located next to the Import drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen.jpg"                      alt="Filmora9 Record PC Screen"                ></p><p>You can then choose if you want to record videos using the built-in or external webcam, record a voiceover or capture your computer’s screen and webcam video at the same time. Select the Record PC Screen option and wait for the Wondershare Filmora Scrn window to pop up on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen-3.jpg"                      alt="Filmora9 PC Screen Recording Settings"                ></p><p>Click on the Settings icon in the lower right corner of the window if you want to change the frame rate of the video you’re creating or adjust its quality. The screen recorder lets you capture an entire screen, a target window, and it offers the possibility to specify the portion of the screen you would like to capture.</p><p>Connecting an <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also an option if you don’t want to record the voiceover with your computer’s built-in microphone. Selecting the destination folder where your recordings are going to be saved, picking a preferred <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or choosing the quality of the video you’re capturing are also among the options you’ll have at your disposal.</p><p>Make sure to tick the Show Mouse Clicks in Recording checkbox if you would like your video to include all mouse clicks you make during a screen capturing session. Filmora also offers the option to record all mouse click sounds, but most content creators disable this setting as mouse clicks can be very repetitive.</p><p>Record the Camera Stream checkbox is located at the bottom of the Wondershare Filmora Scrn window, and you have to click on it if you want to record your computer screen and the webcam video simultaneously. By default, the computer’s built-in webcam is going to be selected, but you can also select an external webcam you connected to your computer, from the drop-down menu located directly below the Record the Camera Stream checkbox.</p><p>Optionally, you can set the keyboard shortcuts that enable you to start, stop, pause and resume a screen recording session. Click on the Record button when ready and proceed to record your computer’s screen and the webcam stream simultaneously.</p><p>After the screen capturing session, the video file you created will be located in the destination folder you specified and appeared in the media library automatically, so you just have to place it onto the timeline if you want to edit it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Computer-Screen-and-Webcam-Video-at-the-same-time-on-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Computer-Screen-and-Webcam-Video-at-the-same-time-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record a Computer Screen and Webcam Video at the same time on Windows 10?"></a>Part 2: How to Record a Computer Screen and Webcam Video at the same time on Windows 10?</h2><p>All you need to do in order to access the Game Bar on Windows 10 is to use the Win + G keyboard shortcut. The screen capturing options you will have at your disposal are underwhelming at best since you won’t be able to select the resolution or the frame rate of the video you’re recording. However, you just need to enable the microphone and click on the Record button to start capturing the gameplay of the video game you’re playing or any other activity on your computer.</p><p>Even though it is possible to record a webcam video and capture a screen simultaneously, you can only do so if you install additional encoders. It may take a while to figure out the exact steps of this highly technical process, and once you do, you still won’t be able to record the webcam video stream and capture a computer screen with the same app.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Capturing-Screens-with-Loom-Extension-for-Google-Chrome"><a href="#Part-3-Capturing-Screens-with-Loom-Extension-for-Google-Chrome" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Capturing Screens with Loom Extension for Google Chrome"></a>Part 3: Capturing Screens with Loom Extension for Google Chrome</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loom-video-recorder-scree/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb?hl=en-US" >Loom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> extension for Google Chrome web browser offers a simple and easy solution to all PC users who would like to record screens and webcam videos at the same time. The extension can be downloaded for free, and the setup process won’t take much more than a few moments. Before you can start using Loom, you must first sign in using your Google account and then grant the extension access to your computer’s microphone and camera.</p><p>This extension for Google Chrome lets you choose if you want to record only the computer’s screen, webcam or both at the same time. Furthermore, you can specify which microphone and camera you would like to use during a screen capturing session before you hit the record button. Loom will record all of your screen activities and you can use it to record your gaming experiences, create tutorials or any other type of video that includes the tasks you perform on your computer.</p><p>However, you may meet some audio quality issues on some occasions, and once recorded, the editing options are limited (though I can add A CTA button and do some setting, I can’t do other editing such as add title, adjust speed and mute audio in the video except trimming).</p><p>So, if you want to record the webcam and screen at the same time, and edit the recorded footage further with effects, transitions, titles, we recommend you to try Filmora. Filmora is easy to use and powerful enough to record, and edit your video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Including the webcam footage in your screen recordings can make them more entertaining to watch, since viewers can actually see the person who is talking to them. Although Windows 10’s Game Bar features the tools you are going to need to record a computer screen, capturing the webcam video stream simultaneously is a highly technical and time-consuming task. That is why it is much better to use Filmora or the Loom extension for Google Chrome if you want to record your screen and use a webcam at the same time.

So, video-conferencing applications provide their users with a whiteboard to keep track of the discussion during a video call. <strong>Google Meet whiteboarding</strong> is one of the most effective tools for Google Meet users to make explanations easy. You can draw things on a <strong>whiteboard in Google Meet</strong> to make the video session more interactive and exciting.</p><p>If you are interested in using this fantastic tool, the following article will cover all the relevant details alongside an easy guide to use a whiteboard. Let’s get started.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is Jamboard or Whiteboard on Google Meet?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on a Laptop?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on iPhone?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an Android Device?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Save and Send Jams as PDFs?</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Jamboard-or-Whiteboard-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Jamboard-or-Whiteboard-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Jamboard or Whiteboard on Google Meet?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is Jamboard or Whiteboard on Google Meet?</strong></h2><p>Google Meet has been a useful video communication facility for professionals and students. Google Meet integrates Jamboard, an online tool that enables you to brainstorm ideas during the virtual meet-up. The meeting host can easily activate Jamboard after starting a meeting. This makes <strong>Google Meet Whiteboarding</strong> easily accessible for all participants during the live session. In this way, students can collaborate with instructors or other students very clearly. Moreover, the whiteboard feature also allows them to answer questions and review notes. Let’s know how to use a whiteboard in Google Meet and how it works.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-a-Laptop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-a-Laptop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on a Laptop?"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on a Laptop?</strong></h2><p>The in-built whiteboard can be comfortably used in Google Meet on a laptop. You do not need any extension or third-party application to use a whiteboard. Moreover, you can create a new whiteboard or use the one you have already created. You can access the already saved whiteboard from Google Drive. If you want to excel in the art of creating a whiteboard on Google Meet, we have summarized the process in simple steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Join Google Meeting</strong></p><p>Open Google Meet and click <strong>new meeting</strong> to host a meeting.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You may also join the meeting using the invitation code or invite link.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Locate the whiteboard.</strong></p><p>Click on the <strong>three dots</strong> at the bottom of your screen and select <strong>the whiteboard</strong> at the top of the menu list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-whiteboard.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet whiteboard"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Create Whiteboard</strong></p><p>Click on the <strong>start a new whiteboard</strong> option**.**</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This will create a Jam that can be used to visualize ideas on a whiteboard. The link to the Jam can be copied and sent to all participants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-whiteboard.jpg"                      alt="create Google Meet whiteboard"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, you cannot access the <strong>Google Meet Whiteboarding</strong> feature when using Google Meet through its website on your smartphone. Thus, it is recommended to use third-party tools for using the whiteboard feature. In this case, you have to share your screen in the Google Meet session and then navigate to the third-party app having a built-in whiteboard. However, the participants will not be able to make any changes on the whiteboard, and they can only watch the visuals of your screen. Are you an iPhone user and want to use whiteboard apps? If yes, the following step-by-step guide will help you.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Microsoft whiteboard app</strong></p><p>Navigate the Microsoft app in the app store and click install.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Join Google meeting room and share screen</strong></p><p>Click three dots at the bottom and select share screen. Press the <strong>start sharing</strong> button to confirm the action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Use whiteboard in the Microsoft app</strong></p><p>Go to your home page and launch the Microsoft Whiteboard.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since you will be sharing the screen of your iPhone, participants will be able to see your whiteboard activity.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an Android Device"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an Android Device</strong></h2><p>Similar to iPhone, you cannot use the in-built Jamboard Google Meet tool on Android devices. Even if you try accessing Google Meet from the browser on your android phone, you are likely to be redirected to Google Meet, where there is no whiteboard option. So, the only way out is to download an external whiteboard app from Playstore and use its whiteboard. Your whiteboard activity will be visible to other participants in a Google Meet session when you share the screen. However, this option is only viable if you are the only one illustrating on the whiteboard and no other participants are required to perform any whiteboard activity. If this works for you, follow the step-by-step guide below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Whiteboard application</strong></p><p><strong>Find the Whiteboard app on the Google Playstore and click install</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Join Meeting and Share screen</strong></p><p><strong>Click new meeting and press dots at the bottom of your screen. Select the screen sharing option and confirm it.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 3: Access the Whiteboard app</strong></p><p><strong>Navigate to your home page and launch the whiteboard app. What you draw on the whiteboard will be visible to the meeting attendees.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-whiteboard-mobile.jpg"                      alt="create Google Meet whiteboard on mobile"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134489/18498" target="_top" id="2134489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134489/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136619/26400" target="_top" id="2136619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136619/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Save-and-Send-Jams-as-PDFs"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Save-and-Send-Jams-as-PDFs" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Save and Send Jams as PDFs?"></a><strong>Bonus: How to Save and Send Jams as PDFs?</strong></h2><p>Once you end up in a meeting, the Jamboard activity can be shared in a PDF file.
