The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123727/7443" target="_top" id="2123727">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123727" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123727/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-RetroArch-Emulator"><a href="#1-RetroArch-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="1.RetroArch Emulator"></a>1.RetroArch Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/retroarch-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="retroarch-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising. If you purchase the pro edition in the game, you will be able to remove the advertisements. If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse. You will find Matsu Emulator to be a reliable and efficient program if you can endure its commercials.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>It features an on-screen virtual keypad as well as support for gamepads.</li><li>The sound quality is excellent.</li><li>As well as fast-forwarding, it also supports rewinding.</li><li>Up to 16 slots can be used by the Matsu emulator.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770776">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770776">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770776%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770776/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Mednafen"><a href="#3-Mednafen" class="headerlink" title="3.Mednafen"></a>3.Mednafen</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png"                      alt="mednafen-poster-ps1"                ></p><p>Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator.

That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134244/18498" target="_top" id="2134244">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134244" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134244/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator-3"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136545/16384" target="_top" id="2136545">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136545" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136545/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising. If you purchase the pro edition in the game, you will be able to remove the advertisements. If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse. You will find Matsu Emulator to be a reliable and efficient program if you can endure its commercials.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>It features an on-screen virtual keypad as well as support for gamepads.</li><li>The sound quality is excellent.</li><li>As well as fast-forwarding, it also supports rewinding.</li><li>Up to 16 slots can be used by the Matsu emulator.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135361/19272" target="_top" id="2135361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Mednafen-3"><a href="#3-Mednafen-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Mednafen"></a>3.Mednafen</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png"                      alt="mednafen-poster-ps1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115941/19272" target="_top" id="2115941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator.

Record with Game Bar"></a>Way 1. Record with Game Bar</h2><p>You most likely have Windows 10 installed on your Dell laptop. Windows 10 comes with an inbuilt screen recorder called Game Bar. You can record your screen as well as capture screenshots as per your requirements. You even capture your system as well as external mic audio.

Use VLC Screen Recorder"></a>Way 2. Use VLC Screen Recorder</h2><p>Even though Windows Media Player is the default medial player on Windows, users prefer VLC Media Player over Windows Media Player.

The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera. The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115946/19272" target="_top" id="2115946">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115946" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115946/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-2"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098705/14409" target="_top" id="2098705">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098705" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098705/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-2"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined.

Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device.

The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera. The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129041/19576" target="_top" id="2129041">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129041" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129041/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-3"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu.

The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014849/22899" target="_top" id="2014849">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014849" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014849/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined.

While using a smartphone, ensure that it has enough battery to last at least for a couple of hours, and doesn’t exhaust during the meeting. For laptops, it is advisable to use an average quality headset with a microphone instead of onboard speakers and mic.</p><h4 id="Tip-2-Meeting-Transcription-Software-Security"><a href="#Tip-2-Meeting-Transcription-Software-Security" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Meeting Transcription Software Security"></a>Tip 2: Meeting Transcription Software Security</h4><p>While subscribing for any third-party transcription service, make sure to check their privacy policies and confirm if they are agreeable. Since you will be uploading quite sensitive information that may contain your trade secrets, only the service provider with good privacy policy and robust encryption algorithms should be allowed to handle your files.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom transcriptions</strong>  come in handy when you plan to discuss some crucial matters in a meeting, and want all the details to be documented with proper timestamps. In case it is a video conference that is to be recorded, you can choose a service provider that offers close and open captioning as well.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Improve Video Quality in Zoom Meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123477/16836" target="_top" id="2123477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123477/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-uniting-your-network-with-cross-platform-skype-chat-groups-a-how-to-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Uniting Your Network with Cross-Platform Skype Chat Groups A How-To Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-epic-journey-through-memory-lane-advanced-methods-for-capturing-your-sims-digital-adventures/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Epic Journey Through Memory Lane Advanced Methods for Capturing Your Sims' Digital Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-illuminate-your-recording-setup-how-to-prevent-a-dark-screen-on-obs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Illuminate Your Recording Setup How to Prevent a Dark Screen on OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-peak-hours-for-podcasts-strategic-timing/"><u>2024 Approved Peak Hours for Podcasts Strategic Timing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-peering-into-popularity-twitters-top-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Peering Into Popularity Twitter’s Top Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/behind-the-screencast-scenes-industry-secrets-revealed-for-2024/"><u>Behind the Screencast Scenes Industry Secrets Revealed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/complimentary-multiplatform-mp4-decoder-setup-for-seamless-media-playback-on-windowsmac-osx/"><u>Complimentary Multiplatform MP4 Decoder Setup for Seamless Media Playback on Windows/Mac OSX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/enhanced-windows-paint-experience-with-improved-editing-features/"><u>Enhanced Windows Paint Experience with Improved Editing Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-detect-and-remove-spyware-on-asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-self-supported-youtube-earnings-strategies-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Self-Supported YouTube Earnings Strategies for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

A few things you can look for to check your Internet connection go as below:</p><ul><li>Try to <strong>power cycle your router and modem</strong> . Unplug the power cables from your router and your modem, leave them disconnected for at least 30 seconds, then plug the cables back into both devices. When your Internet is working again, check if you still get the error code leaf.</li><li>If you’re playing Apex Legends on Wi-Fi, make sure there’s no overcrowding. In other words, <strong>if your Wi-Fi is connected to multiple devices, disconnect the ones you don’t need at the moment.</strong><br> (Also if possible,<strong>play on</strong> <strong>a wired connection</strong> . It’d provide a more stable and reliable connection.)</li><li>If you have low-speed Internet, it could lead to an unstable Internet connection. You can google “Internet speed test” and pick a tool to<strong>test your Internet speed</strong> . However, when your Internet connection is unreasonably slow, consider contacting your Internet provider for help.</li></ul><p> If your Internet connection is valid but you still don’t get response from the Apex Legends servers, try the next fix.</p><h2 id="Fix-2-Install-all-the-game-updates"><a href="#Fix-2-Install-all-the-game-updates" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Install all the game updates"></a>Fix 2: Install all the game updates</h2><p> This one may seem obvious, but it did help some players to solve the error code leaf when they try to join a match on Apex Legends, so you may want to make sure your game is updated all the time.</p><p> The good new is, the Origin client and the Steam client will automatically download available updates and install them for you, so you don’t actually have to worry. However, if you’ve turned off the automatic updating option at some point before, make sure you turn it on or manually install the updates for your Apex Legends.</p><p> If your game stays up-to-date but you still run into error code leaf, move on to the next fix.</p><h2 id="Fix-3-Configure-your-DNS-settings"><a href="#Fix-3-Configure-your-DNS-settings" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Configure your DNS settings"></a>Fix 3: Configure your DNS settings</h2><p> When you use your ISP’s (Internet Service Provider) default DNS server, some possible issues like crowded cache could cause the server connection failure. What you can do is switching to a public DNS server to solve the problem. We’ll use the Google DNS server as an example. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>On your taskbar, right-click the<strong>network icon</strong> , then click<strong>Open Network &amp; Internet settings</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/open-network-settings.png"                                     ></li><li>Click<strong>Change adapter options</strong> .</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424528">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424528">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424528%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424528/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/change-adapter-options.png"                                     ><br>3.

You may want to update your network adapter driver to make sure it’s functioning properly.</p><p> There are two ways you can get the right driver for your network adapter:<strong>manually</strong> or<strong>automatically</strong> .</p><p><strong>Manual driver update</strong> – You can update the network adapter driver<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >via Device Manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Note that Windows doesn’t update its database very frequently. That said, it’s possible that your network adapter driver needs an update, but Device Manager can’t do it for you if it doesn’t detect a new version in the Windows database.</p><p><strong>Automatic driver update</strong> – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact network adapter and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:</p><ol><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install Driver Easy.</p></li><li><p>Run Driver Easy and click the <strong>Scan Now</strong> button.

One last thing that players can do is to switch to a low ping server.

Using OBS game capture, you may record screen games for YouTube videos or share snippets of gameplay with your friends for free. With this article, we’ll cover how to record in OBS and how much storage space you’ll need for your recordings. With OBS, it’s easy to keep track of high scores, great in-game performances, and even tips on how to play like a pro quickly and effectively. Since gamers may use several third-party screen-recording techniques when recording their games, learning how to record gameplay using OBS is an ideal solution. An open-source tool called OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) will be utilized in this lesson.</p><p>It is widely utilized by both large and small broadcasters throughout the world because of its reliability as a streaming solution. Despite this, it’s an effective tool for capturing images. OBS Studio enables you to record video directly to your device instead of broadcasting your screen. The days of framed screenshots and complex settings are over. Video game streamers and teachers with a lot of video presentations are likely to be acquainted with the OBS Studio. However, due to the complex user interface, it’s a little tough for beginners to utilize. The good news is that there are a variety of OBS options to pick from. When it comes to performance, it’s on par with other, more costly options. For the most part, the program allows for live streaming to several sites, such as Facebook Live and Hitbox.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1155462">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1155462.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1155462">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1155462.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1155462%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1155462/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="1.

Best OBS Settings for Mac"></a>2. Best OBS Settings for Mac</h2><p>OBS Studio is a complex software that comes with pre-installed screencasting capabilities. Free software often lacks the breadth of features required for flawless broadcasting, but not with OSB Studio. Even though the program is free, it features all of the crucial components that characterize online broadcasting. Many additional parts and modules will be given by the software now and then. That suggests it’s really necessary to dabble and refresh with it. Else, you can experience a few hassles in using OBS correctly.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch and Create Output Recorder Setup</strong></p><p>Add on the Plus symbol and create the project. If you want to activate audio monitoring in OBS Studio: Right-click in the Output box, Open the Output mode or you can also go for Advanced Audio Properties:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-recorder-setup.jpg"                      alt="output recorder setup"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Customize Record Only Feature</strong></p><p>In OBS for Mac, this setting will deliver the sound of the source to the Desktop as it were. Work area sound should be enabled for the sound to be captured. As soon as you activate this option, navigate towards the recording interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record.jpg"                      alt="customize record"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Set the Screen and Output Mode</strong></p><p>In OBS Studio for Mac, this setting will broadcast the sound of the source to the stream and Desktop sound separately.

This strategy may be used to solve the problem if you have two graphics cards, one of which is NVIDIA. The OBS black screen is most likely caused by OBS and the game you desire to record running on different graphics cards in this situation. The image of the game can’t be acquired as they’re on separate adapters, and it’s not available on the device OBS is utilizing.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install and Launch OBS</strong></p><p>To purchase OBS Studio, go to the OBS Project’s official website and join up for their download portal. OBS is available for download and installation. After that, determine whether you want to use Windows, macOS, or Linux. Click the “Windows” download option on the left to acquire OBS for Windows.

The next step is for users to go to the Audio tab and deactivate Desktop Audio. Users may add an audio input device, such as a microphone, by setting the Mic&#x2F;Auxiliary device under the same tab.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Setup the Recording</strong></p><p>Now, in the bottom left corner of the screen, click the “Scene” button, and then tap the Add icon next to the scene tab under the sources tab.

Users may meet face to face, communicate with associates via in-meeting chatting or conference call, &amp; share their presentations via screen sharing.</p><p>Meetings may be accessed via a PC, Mac, iOS, or Android device. All GoToMeeting sessions (also known as webinars) can be recorded. This article explains how to record a <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> session in detail, including a step-by-step approach.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Use the Best GoToMeeting Recorder on PC</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record GoToMeeting with an Online Recorder</a></p><p>Part 4. <a href="#part4">Record GoToMeeting on iPhone and Android</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-in-GoToMeeting-with-Built-in-Recorder"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-in-GoToMeeting-with-Built-in-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder"></a>Part 1. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</h2><p>Meetings can be recorded using the built-in <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> option, but there are limits.</p><p>However, recording options must be set up before the commencement of the session. You can only record meetings using GoToMeeting’s meeting recorder if you have a premium account and admin authorization, making it a much less convenient option to record meetings.</p><p>Step 1. Just click over the “REC” icon at the top of the GoToMeeting screen once you have joined a meeting to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-start-record.jpg"                      alt="gotomeeting start record"                ></p><p>Step 2. While recording, click “Start Your Recording,” and the “REC” icon will become red. The recording of the meeting will be announced to all participants.</p><p>Step 3. Click over the “REC” icon and choose “Stop Your Recording” to stop the recording. If you’re making a local recording, the Recording Manager will open up and ask you to convert the video. However, if you’re doing a cloud recording, you’ll be sent to your online account to retrieve the footage. It takes some time for new recordings to appear in the cloud recording history.</p><p>Step 4. However, what if other participants, such as not account owners or organizers, wish to record live sessions?

You can only record meetings using GoToMeeting’s meeting recorder if you have a premium account and admin authorization, making it a much less convenient option to record meetings.</p><p>Step 1. Just click over the “REC” icon at the top of the GoToMeeting screen once you have joined a meeting to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-start-record.jpg"                      alt="gotomeeting start record"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120867/26400?prodsku=mars" target="_top" id="2120867">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120867" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120867/26400?prodsku=mars"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 2.
