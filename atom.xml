Some of the most common Zoom audio problems and their possible solutions are discussed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-audio-advanced-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Zoom Meeting Settings Advanced Audio Settings "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It"><a href="#What-Is-It" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Audio feedback loop is when your voice keeps repeating itself for an indefinite number of times and never stops whatsoever.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >6 Top Voice Changer for Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h5 id="How-It-Happens"><a href="#How-It-Happens" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>When you are using external speakers and microphone, and both are placed nearby, any sound that comes out of the speaker is received by the microphone. If Zoom is configured to accept sounds from system audio, the mic sends the signals back to the speakers that again send the audio output to the mic. Since this iteration never ends, you continuously hear an audio feedback loop.</p><h5 id="How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?"></a>How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>In order to eliminate this issue, make sure to place both microphone and speakers at a safe distance from each other. This would prevent the microphone from receiving any output from the speakers, and the chain of audio feedback loop would never take place.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-1"><a href="#What-Is-It-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Background noise is the distortion or humming that you hear during an audio call on zoom.</p><h5 id="Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?"></a>Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>If you have a highly sensitive microphone that is mostly used by professionals or in recording studios, the chances are that it will catch a lot of background noise during a Zoom meeting.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?</h5><p>This issue can be resolved by either hosting or joining a meeting in a closed, soundproof room, or using a less sensitive mic. It would be best if you use a normal headset that is easily available in any local electronic shop. You can also try enabling the <strong>Automatically adjust volume</strong> option from the <strong>Microphone</strong> section of the <strong>Audio</strong> category of the <strong>Settings</strong> box as explained earlier in <strong>Step 3</strong> of the <strong>Zoom Audio Settings When Not in Meeting</strong> section.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-2"><a href="#What-Is-It-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p><strong>Zoom audio echo</strong> is when you hear an echo sound during an ongoing Zoom meeting with audio enabled.</p><h5 id="How-It-Happens-1"><a href="#How-It-Happens-1" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>Echo happens when you are on a laptop and are using onboard speakers and microphone, and that too with the speaker or mic volume set to maximum.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?</h5><p>As mentioned earlier, it is always advisable to use a headset to avoid any such unwanted echo or audio feedback loop issues. In case you don’t have access to a headset, try configuring the microphone settings to automatically adjust the volume, and not putting the speaker volume to the max.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Configuring <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong> before hosting or joining a meeting is always a wise approach to avoid any audio inconsistencies during an ongoing conference. However, if you are already in one, you can use the methods given above to configure the microphone settings to get the audio right. You are also encouraged to use an average quality headset during a Zoom meeting to avoid any <strong>Zoom audio echo</strong>, feedback loop, or background noises.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"

Different versions of OBS studio are available for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft windows.

But, as you most probably know, most of these documents are large in size and somewhat difficult to share. Instead of wasting time waiting for a file to upload, you can simply take a screenshot and create a file that is easy to share within seconds.</p><p>On the other hand, The Internet contains such a vast amount of information, that it is sometimes easier to just capture an entire screen than it is to share a link. Luckily, you don’t have to be a skilled photo editor who knows how to merge several screenshots of a scroll page of any kind, into a single image, because there are many easier ways to accomplish this task.

Click on the <strong>Change</strong> icon and select the <strong>Microsoft XPS Document Writer</strong>, if you are using Google Chrome to create a new document that contains the entire page. You can also create a PDF file, but this file format may include the ads or other overlaying elements on the web page.

The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus ‘+’ sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the outer by adding an ‘L’ shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle5.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle6.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle6"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft"><a href="#How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft" class="headerlink" title="How to make a Sphere in Minecraft"></a>How to make a Sphere in Minecraft</h2><p>The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now it’s time to create layers of the sphere. To do that you have to create a layer of 7 blocks wide on the top and the bottom of the column.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Since you have created the 1st and the 16th levels of the sphere, now you have to follow this procedure for all remaining layers: Make a layer of 11 blocks for the 2nd and 15th levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Follow the same pattern throughout the levels: 13 blocks layer on 3rd and 14th level, 15 blocks on 4th and 13th levels, 17 blocks on 5th and 12th level, and so on. As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks. Follow this process until you reach the middle of the column.</p><p>These circles and spheres are useful in Minecraft and they play a very vital role in building your own world in Minecraft. They can be very beneficial while creating buildings, houses, and more places. These can be used as curves to give your buildings an aesthetic look and feel. But this whole process needs practice and efforts to master it and use it for your own purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere4"                ></p><hr><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Creating such amazing things and sharing them on your social media and video sharing platforms can get you a lot of audience and views.

It’s ad-free, doesn’t need root, has no restriction on recording time, and doesn’t apply watermarks. It’s not a terrible bargain at all. After you’ve downloaded it, go through the following steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><ul><li>Start the AZ Screen Recorder app by selecting it from your app drawer.</li><li>You’ll notice a four-button overlay emerge. The gear icon allows you to change the video recording parameters, including resolution, bit rate, and frame rate. Press Back to go to the home screen when you’re finished.</li><li>Start the app or browse to the screen you wish to capture and press “Record”.</li><li>AZ overlay’s AZ button has a red camera shutter icon. The video is about to start recording. Until you’re ready to stop recording, continue to use your phone usually.</li><li>Remove your finger from the notification shade when you’re done. You have the option of pausing or stopping the recording from the AZ notification.</li></ul><h3 id="For-iOS"><a href="#For-iOS" class="headerlink" title="For iOS"></a>For iOS</h3><p>Fortunately, if you understand how to activate it, taking a screenshot or recording a video on your iPhone’s screen is exactly as simple as before.

Look for the phrase “Screen Recording.” Tap the green + symbol next to it if it’s not already in the “Include” section. It should now appear in the “Include” column.</li><li>If you have an iPhone X or later, slide down from the top-right corner to activate the Control Center; swipe up if you have an iPhone 8 or older. The home button on an iPhone may be accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the display.</li><li>Press and hold the “Record” button. This feature is activated by pressing the Record button for three seconds, after which the button becomes red and begins recording. The time will be red in the top left corner, indicating that you’re still recording.</li><li>Press the red time indication at the upper left of the screen, then tap “Stop” to stop recording.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4550420&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/pic/f_02.jpg"                      border="0"                >PearlMountain Image Converter</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-1"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

As Geralt of Rivia, you have an open world and several amazing places to be explored. The Wild Hunt feature of this game lets you play an amazing storyline and kill monsters that cross your way. Apart from the main story, the players are allowed to perform side tasks. If you have watched the Netflix series, The Witcher, you can easily relate this game to it. It almost contains all the same features of that series and can provide you with the same experience.</p><h4 id="8-Star-Wars-Jedi-Fallen-Order"><a href="#8-Star-Wars-Jedi-Fallen-Order" class="headerlink" title="8.

This is a game like Ghost of Tsushima that puts you in the shoes of a Jedi Padawan, known as Cal Kestis. Just like Ghost of Tsushima, this game is also based on melee combats. On this journey of the universe, you will encounter so many monsters and foes. Protect yourself and kill all those who are against you with the help of your lightsaber. Cal is also given the power of force to use against his enemies to kill them.</p><h4 id="9-Middle-earth-Shadow-of-War"><a href="#9-Middle-earth-Shadow-of-War" class="headerlink" title="9.

It is a battle-intense game that allows you to use melee combats to protect your people and kingdom. To stop the Sauron’s army, you have to use the melee mastery and spiritual connection to use the power against the army. It seems impossible to stop this army at first sight, but when using your full potential and power gathered from spiritual beings, this is not a big deal to defeat them. This game contains a wide range of weapons to use and creatures to fight with. You have to use new strategies and plans to defeat them in the battle, making this game thrilling and adventurous.</p><h4 id="10-God-of-War-4"><a href="#10-God-of-War-4" class="headerlink" title="10.

Chill, you don’t need a professional studio for this purpose. There is a lot of software, but zoom podcast recording is relatively more straightforward. A podcast is a collection of audio files that you can either download or listen to online using the internet. This article will help you learn to record podcasts using zoom.</p><h2 id="7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom"><a href="#7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?"></a>7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?</h2><p>Recording a podcast on zoom is quite simple and easy. You don’t need to be a recording expert; you can get it done at home using your laptop. In this article, I will guide you on how to record a podcast using zoom step by step.</p><h5 id="Step1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#Step1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download and Install"></a>Step1 Download and Install</h5><p>The 1st step is downloading and installing zoom on your device. Next, create your zoom account by visiting the <a class="link"   href="https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/?url=https://zoom.us&id=5&geo=&ub=https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/&gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966AtsDXlasyuqO9r1vrbTzSdxKyOMLNsfNLa_RFZ12PRcu09P4sKnMcaAlUHEALw_wcB" >zoom website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Log in to this account with your installed software and enjoy zoom free. The free version allows you to record for 40 minutes. For longer calls, purchase the paid version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-1.jpg"                      alt="download and install zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones"><a href="#Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones"></a>Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones</h5><p>Zoom can use your device’s built-in microphone, but it is advised to use a high-quality external mic. It enhances the quality of your podcast tremendously. Plenty of external mics are available for under 50$, which can make a real difference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-2.jpg"                      alt="set up microphone and headphones"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise"><a href="#Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise"></a>Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise</h5><p>No one is interested in listening to what’s happening in the background while listening to your podcast. So, before pressing the ‘Record’ button, ensure your environment is as quiet as possible. You can take the following steps to reduce background noises.</p><ul><li>Turn off the fan, air conditioner, or any other noisy appliances.</li><li>Remove noisy kids, roommates, or pets.</li><li>Hang a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on your front door.</li><li>Shut your door and windows to avoid noise from outside sources, such as sirens, traffic horns, etc.</li><li>Avoid the rustling sound of paper or moving things around your desk.</li><li>Install noise-canceling software to filter out any background noise.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-3.jpg"                      alt="eliminate background noise"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker"><a href="#Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker"></a>Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker</h5><p>Wouldn’t it be easier to edit your podcast if you recorded audio tracks for each speaker separately? Zoom has this feature of recording separate audio tracks.</p><p>To enable this, go to your zoom ‘Settings’ and click on the ‘Recording’ setting. Then select “Record a separate audio file for each participant,” and you are ready to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-4.jpg"                      alt="separate audio tracks for each speaker"                ></p><h5 id="Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin"><a href="#Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin"></a>Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin</h5><p>If you are going live and your guest is new to zoom, it is better that you guide him briefly about the functioning of zoom. Guide your guest on how to join the call using zoom. It would be best if you also told him about the duration and topic of your podcast.</p><p>It is advised to test the microphone and headphones of your guest before starting a live podcast. Your guest does not need to download and install zoom on their device; he can join by clicking the link and entering the call from his browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-5.jpg"                      alt="brief the guest about zoom functioning"                ></p><h5 id="Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom"><a href="#Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom"></a>Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom</h5><p>It is pretty simple to record a podcast using zoom. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p><ol><li>Click on the ‘New Meeting’ button to initiate the call.</li><li>Now click on the ‘Invite’ button.</li><li>Select ‘Copy Invitation’ and copy the ID and password of your meeting</li><li>Share the ID and passcode with your guest.</li><li>Ask your guest to join the call by clicking on the link.</li><li>After your guest joins the call, press ‘Manage Participants’ at the bottom of the screen.</li><li>You will see a list of all the participants. Please make sure everyone’s microphone is working and their voices are clear.</li><li>Click on the participant name you want to make a co-host and press the make co-host button.</li><li>Click the ‘Record’ button and turn on ‘Original Sound’ to start recording the podcast.</li><li>When the podcast is complete, click on the ‘End’ button and then click on ‘End Meeting for All.’</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-6.jpg"                      alt="record the call using zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step7-Edit-the-Audio-File-Using-Editing-Tools"><a href="#Step7-Edit-the-Audio-File-Using-Editing-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Edit the Audio File Using Editing Tools"></a>Step7 Edit the Audio File Using Editing Tools</h5><p>At the end of the recording session, you will get two different file types. An MP4 audio file that you can edit using audio editors and an MP4 video file that you can edit and post on youtube or any other social media platform.</p><p>If you have recorded separate audio tracks for each speaker, you will get separate MP4 audio files for each speaker with that person’s name. You can edit the audio tracks with professional podcast editing software, like Audacity editor or Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-7.jpg"                      alt="edit audio using editor"                ></p><p>We have discussed how to use zoom for recording podcasts, and now we will look at the benefits of using zoom to record podcasts.</p><h3 id="The-Benefits-of-Using-Zoom-To-Record-Your-Podcasts"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Using-Zoom-To-Record-Your-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Using Zoom To Record Your Podcasts"></a>The Benefits of Using Zoom To Record Your Podcasts</h3><ul><li>You can host any podcast on zoom- a solo one where you are the speaker, hosting a speaker, or co-hosting with another podcaster.</li><li>Co-host with anyone you want with a particular social distancing meanwhile.</li><li>Share the screen with the attendees in just a few clicks.</li><li>Built-in feature splits audio and video and makes editing much more accessible.</li><li>Can accommodate multiple participants when there are more speakers</li><li>The audience may feel more involved in the discussion.</li></ul><h2 id="Limitations-of-Using-Zoom-for-Podcasts"><a href="#Limitations-of-Using-Zoom-for-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of Using Zoom for Podcasts"></a>Limitations of Using Zoom for Podcasts</h2><p>Having discussed the method to record podcasts with zoom and the benefits of using zoom, we will now discuss the limitations of zoom for podcast recording.

Its features, such as a built-in recorder and separate audio tracks for each speaker, make it great for podcasting. But you can’t use it for professional purposes because it compresses the audio files and reduces their quality.</p><h3 id="3-How-do-I-host-a-podcast-on-Zoom"><a href="#3-How-do-I-host-a-podcast-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="3.

Create a meeting ID and passcode and invite people to your podcast by sending them the meeting ID and passcode. People can also join your meeting directly by clicking the link you provide. After people join your meeting, you can host a podcast. If you want to publish your podcast, you can start recording it from settings, edit it, and post it.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>In this article, we learned that recording and editing podcasts using suitable software is pretty straightforward. Zoom is ideal for hosting and recording podcasts for beginners.</p><p>Zoom alternatives such as Wondershare Filmora can be used to record podcasts for more professional use. In addition, Filmora can record a podcast in much better quality. Another advantage of preferring Filmora over zoom is its editing capability.</p><p>Edit your recorded podcast using Filmora’s unique transitions and effects and post it on youtube, Vimeo, or any other

So, the technology is continuously evolving to give the participants the best video-conferencing experience. Grid view is one of the features that video-conferencing applications provide to their users to see all participants.</p><p>Previously, only 4 participants could be viewed in the Grid view mode. However, Google Meet has introduced a tiled layout in an update that lets you see 49 participants simultaneously on the screen. The following article will educate you about enabling grid and tiled view in Google Meet and address some other relevant concerns.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Enable-Tiled-View-in-Google-Meet-to-See-Everyone-on-Desktop"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Enable-Tiled-View-in-Google-Meet-to-See-Everyone-on-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Enable Tiled View in Google Meet to See Everyone on Desktop?"></a>Part 1: How to Enable Tiled View in Google Meet to See Everyone on Desktop?</h2><p>The tiled view is one of the preferred layout options in Google Meet. Tiled view in Google Meet expanded the range of visible participants. So, if you have joined a video conference room of many participants, Google Meet tiled layout can help you view all participants simultaneously.</p><p>Moreover, when the speaker switches among participants, the screen does not change when the tiled mode is enabled. Do you want to learn how to enable tiled view in Google Meet on desktop? If yes, follow the simple steps below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open Google Meet and join the meeting</strong></p><p>Access the Google Meet website or launch its app. Click on the new meeting to start a video session.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also join the meeting using an invitation link or entering code. This works when you are joining the session as a participant, not a host.</p><p>Step 2: Switch to tiled layout</p><p>Click on the <strong>three dots</strong> at the bottom of the screen. Select <strong>change layout</strong> from the menu and choose the <strong>tiled</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-change-layout.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet change layout"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Expand View</strong></p><p>Use a slider to increase or decrease the number of participants you want to see.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The slider can expand the view up to 49 participants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-tiled-view-to-view-participants.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet change enable tiled view"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Enable-Grid-View-on-Google-Meet-Mobile-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Enable-Grid-View-on-Google-Meet-Mobile-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Enable Grid View on Google Meet Mobile Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to Enable Grid View on Google Meet Mobile Apps?</h2><p>Google Meet apps don’t support the change layout option. Thus, there are two approaches to enable the Grid view when participating in a Google Meet session through mobile phone. The following section will explain both methods in a simple step-by-step process.

How do I see everyone on Google Meet mobile?"></a>1. How do I see everyone on Google Meet mobile?</h4><p>Google Meet does not allow to view more than 4 participants simultaneously on iOS and Android Devices. However, if it is crucial for you to monitor the activity of all participants, it is better to use the browser on the phone rather than the application. It is better to enable desktop mode before joining the Google Meeting session on the phone’s browser. And the most people that you can see in the screen is 49 at the time of writing.</p><h4 id="2-Why-can’t-I-install-the-Grid-View-extension"><a href="#2-Why-can’t-I-install-the-Grid-View-extension" class="headerlink" title="2. Why can’t I install the Grid View extension?"></a>2. Why can’t I install the Grid View extension?</h4><p>You might not be able to download the Grid View extension for a couple of reasons. Most of the time, you have a duplicate extension installed. So, you need to delete all duplicate extensions and then re-install the Grid View extension. Another reason for encountering issues when installing an extension can be that you are not downloading it from the right developer.</p><h4 id="3-Can-you-record-a-Google-Meet-in-grid-view"><a href="#3-Can-you-record-a-Google-Meet-in-grid-view" class="headerlink" title="3. Can you record a Google Meet in grid view?"></a>3. Can you record a Google Meet in grid view?</h4><p>If you think about whether one can record a Google Meet session in Grid view, the answer is yes for the one hosting a meeting. So, the person sharing a screen and talking will be recorded, and Google Meet in-built recorder will not record all participants in the tile.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Sometimes, it becomes essential to make all participants visible in the grid. For instance, if you have been asked to invigilate students in an online test, monitoring the activity of all participants becomes your job duty. Like other conferencing apps, Google Meet offers a grid view to see participants in your window. Alongside auto, slide bar, and spotlight, Google Meet facilitates the users with the tiled view. In this article, we have gathered sufficient information on how to enable grid view in Google Meet. Not just on desktop, the article mentions configuring the layout on mobile devices as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"
