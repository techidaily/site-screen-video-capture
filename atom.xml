To stop the recording of the screen of your iOS device, click on the Stop button at the video recorder window.</p><p>8. If you want to edit the video, you can do it in QuickTime (for basic editing). You can also save the recorded video first and then edit it later. You can directly save it as it is in QuickTime by going to File Menu and clicking on save option.</p><p>The recorded video will be saved in .mov file format which you can later export to view on certain devices. You can edit the video later in QuickTime, Wondershare Filmora, or others and share it online for tutorials or demonstration, and whatever you want to do with it. This method of recording the iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen is useful for devices running the iOS version lower than 11. This is a far safer method to record device screen video than jailbreaking. But with the addition of a mobile screen recorder app in iOS 11 and above, it seems a little bit clumsy by using QuickTime.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder is a very useful tool when you want to record tutorials, demonstrations, or report bugs. The demand for mobile screen recorders is rapidly increasing. Youngsters also love recording funny clips and videos to share the video on social media networks and other platforms.

This is somewhat similar to what people did back in the Yahoo! Messenger era. However, unlike Yahoo! Messenger, Zoom doesn’t have open rooms where users could find new friends. Instead, it allows to chat only with those who are connected to each other through a conference call.</p><p>When talking about the chat configurations, all the contextual options can be accessed by clicking the <strong>Settings</strong> (<strong>Gear</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window, and selecting the <strong>Chat</strong> category from the left bar of the <strong>Settings</strong> window that opens up next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-setting.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Settings icon"                ></p><p>Once there, following are the options that you can configure to secure your <strong>Zoom chat</strong> experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Status</strong></li></ul><p>Checked by default, the <strong>Change my status to “Away” when I am inactive for</strong> ‘n’ <strong>minutes</strong> lets you automatically change your active status to <strong>Away</strong> when Zoom doesn’t detect any input from you for a certain amount of time. The inactive time threshold can be configured by entering a value in the available box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unblocking</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Manage blocked users</strong> button next to the <strong>Blocked users</strong> label lets you view the list all the users you have blocked. The <strong>Unblock</strong> button at the bottom of the <strong>Blocked users</strong> box allows you to unblock the users for chatting.</p><ul><li><strong>Push Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The radio buttons under this section let you choose which type of chat messages can trigger push notifications so they are flashed on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-notification-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Nofitications Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Other Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Keywords</strong> button next to the <strong>Receive notifications for</strong> label lets you define the keywords in the chat messages that can trigger notifications.</p><ul><li><strong>DND</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Do not disturb from</strong> checkbox allows you to define the duration of the day when Zoom won’t notify you about any chat messages.</p><ul><li><strong>Message Previews</strong></li></ul><p>When the <strong>Show message preview</strong> box is unchecked, Zoom prevents the text of the chat messages from appearing on the screen, and you must open the message to view its content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom"></a>Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom</h2><p>When it comes to texting there are several options available for you to choose <strong>how to chat in Zoom</strong>. For instance, you can send a message to everyone in the chat or send a private message to one of the participants, mention participant(s) while typing a message, and can even send a file to them if need be. You can learn how to do all these by following their corresponding methods given below:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118312/7443" target="_top" id="2118312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118312/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat"><a href="#1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat" class="headerlink" title="1.

Can Zoom host see private chats?"></a><strong>Q) Is Zoom chat secure, safe, and encrypted? Can Zoom host see private chats?</strong></h4><p><strong>A) Yes and No.</strong></p><p>To answer the first question, Zoom chats are encrypted. However, the encryption is disabled by default and must be enabled by turning on the <strong>Require Encryption for 3rd Party Endpoints (H323&#x2F;SIP)</strong> switch from the <strong>In Meeting (Basic)</strong> section.</p><p>Tips</p><p>As a video call host, if you don’t want the participant to save the chat content, you should enable <strong>Prevent participants from saving chat</strong> and save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-prevent-participants-from-saving-chat.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Saving Settings"                ></p><p>Furthermore, if you have a paid subscription of Zoom, you can use advanced encryption method that is available on the <strong>IM Management</strong> page on your account’s web portal. About the second question, the host cannot see the private messages that the participants send to each other during a meeting session.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing"><a href="#Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing" class="headerlink" title="Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?"></a><strong>Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?</strong></h4><p>A) No.</p><p>As long as you are chatting using <strong>Zoom chat</strong>, other participants cannot see your conversation. However, if there is something else on your screen such as your Facebook profile&#x2F;chat, your email account, or your bank account’s page, all those windows can be viewed by the participants you are sharing your screen with.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom chat</strong> is an easy way to converse with the participants in case there are some typical words that need to be spelled or some files to be shared. These chats are not only encrypted, they can also be controlled by the host so that the participants can send messages only to the host, to each other, or to no one at all.</p><p><img

Following are a few tips you must keep in mind while recording a Zoom meeting for transcription:</p><h4 id="Tip-1-Get-a-Clear-Audio-Recording"><a href="#Tip-1-Get-a-Clear-Audio-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Get a Clear Audio Recording"></a>Tip 1: Get a Clear Audio Recording</h4><p>Make sure that you follow the best practices about the input and output device placements and positioning suggested by Zoom professionals. While using a smartphone, ensure that it has enough battery to last at least for a couple of hours, and doesn’t exhaust during the meeting. For laptops, it is advisable to use an average quality headset with a microphone instead of onboard speakers and mic.</p><h4 id="Tip-2-Meeting-Transcription-Software-Security"><a href="#Tip-2-Meeting-Transcription-Software-Security" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Meeting Transcription Software Security"></a>Tip 2: Meeting Transcription Software Security</h4><p>While subscribing for any third-party transcription service, make sure to check their privacy policies and confirm if they are agreeable. Since you will be uploading quite sensitive information that may contain your trade secrets, only the service provider with good privacy policy and robust encryption algorithms should be allowed to handle your files.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom transcriptions</strong>  come in handy when you plan to discuss some crucial matters in a meeting, and want all the details to be documented with proper timestamps. In case it is a video conference that is to be recorded, you can choose a service provider that offers close and open captioning as well.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Improve Video Quality in Zoom Meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135396/19272" target="_top" id="2135396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135396/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-embark-on-an-avatar-journey-crafting-characters-with-ease-and-style/"><u>[New] In 2024, Embark on an Avatar Journey Crafting Characters with Ease and Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-8-linux-screenshot-utilities-compared/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 8 Linux Screenshot Utilities Compared</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-libertycam-studio-a-user-friendly-review/"><u>[New] LibertyCam Studio A User-Friendly Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-mobile-security-focused-the-leading-10-free-video-calling-applications/"><u>[New] Mobile Security-Focused The Leading 10 Free Video Calling Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-charismatic-oratory-study-part-8-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Charismatic Oratory Study Part 8 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-fives-finest-time-lapse-capture-apps-reviewed-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Five's Finest Time-Lapse Capture Apps Reviewed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-amplifying-zoom-picture-quality-insider-secrets/"><u>2024 Approved Amplifying Zoom Picture Quality Insider Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/cinematography-secrets-unveiled-by-youtube-pros/"><u>Cinematography Secrets Unveiled by YouTube Pros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/elevate-your-media-game-with-winxvideo-ai-pro-enhancer-for-upscaling-stabilizing-transforming-and-professional-video-capture/"><u>Elevate Your Media Game with WinxVideo AI - Pro Enhancer for Upscaling, Stabilizing, Transforming, and Professional Video Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/tial-guide-the-8-best-zero-price-video-cutting-software-for-2024/"><u>Essential Guide The 8 Best Zero Price Video Cutting Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevating-experience-with-the-right-music-for-vids/"><u>In 2024, Elevating Experience with the Right Music for Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/tagging-strategy-the-list-of-powerful-insta-hashtags/"><u>Tagging Strategy The List of Powerful Insta Hashtags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://os-tips.techidaily.com/unlock-your-iphone-potential-with-dfu-mode-comprehensive-entry-and-egress-strategies/"><u>Unlock Your iPhone Potential with DFU Mode: Comprehensive Entry & Egress Strategies</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You can do everything on this single app. If you are searching for software to record videos from a webcam, it is one of the best choices. Let’s start with how to record webcam VLC.</p><p>Step 1: - First, you update our webcam’s firmware. Once you have completed it, you can launch the VLC, visit the view tab, and check out the advanced controls. It will help you put some extra toolbar with the record button on the left corner.</p><p>Step 2: - Next, visit media and click on the capture device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-screen-with-VLC.jpg"                      alt="open capture device"                ></p><p>Step 3: - Now, keep the capture mode as the “DirectShow” and select the audio input and video camera device from the menu.</p><p>You can use any device for both audio and video. It depends upon the setup, and you will choose between various video and audio devices. You must select the right one according to your setup.</p><p>Step 4: - Another option you may want is to select the Advanced options button and then plug in the specific framerate for a video. You can set it up around 30fps, and then you can do a great job by keeping the size of the video file down. You may have to experiment with it a few times to get the best video quality you wish.</p><p>Step 5: - Once you have finished the selection of your video and audio device and set up the frame rate down, then click the Play button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-screen-with-vlc-11.png"                      alt="save vlc recording"                ></p><p>Step 6: - You will have to see yourself or anything you pointed your camera at the main windows. Then, you will have to hit the record button on the toolbar, which you can add earlier for starting the recording.</p><p>Step 7: - For stopping the recording, you will have to hit stop or record again to close the video recording completely. The users will have to find the recording in local video folders on the PC saved as the AVI files.</p><p>Step 8: It is worth noting that if you plan to record your voice, you will have to wear the headset or manage the audio device. Otherwise, the user will hear the voice’s echo through external speakers. The process is very similar for recording the desktop, but you have to choose various media devices.</p><p>In addition, you will need the recording in other formats, and you can also. Finally, use the VLC for converting the videos.

While Microsoft is still working to make the ‘Blur’ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.</p><p>On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:</p><ul><li>Sign out of Teams and then sign back in</li><li>Check for and update the webcam driver</li><li>Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams</li><li>Restart your computer</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?</strong></p><p><strong>A2)</strong> Yes, you can. Microsoft Teams (Free), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard versions allow you to blur the background with ease.
