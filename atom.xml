You can either take a screenshot using the shortcut keys or record your screen by bringing in the tools on the screen To bring the screen recording tools menu on Mac, all you need is to press âCommand + Shift + 4â.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-air-os-use-keyboard-shortcuts.jpg"                      alt="macbook air os use keyboard shortcuts"                ></p><p>After pressing you will be prompted to application windows as shown in the figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-recorder-settings.jpg"                      alt="macbook recorder settings"                ></p><p>Once the application window appears, you must know what each icon on the window means. On the left side of the window, as you can see, you can manage the screenshot of your screen either in full or of some windows or areas. Next is the middle area, which gives you two modes for screen recording, fullscreen mode to record your screen or choose a certain area to record from the screen as shown above in the figure. You can access all the recording settings before pressing to record your screen.</p><p>**<strong>Recording Settings:</strong></p><p>Before starting your screen recording itâs important to adjust for different recording settings as shown in the figure below. Just click the âoptionsâ in the main GUI of the recorder to show it up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-click-the-options.jpg"                      alt="macbook click the options"                ></p><p>You can select your destination folder for saving your records using the âsave toâ bar in the settings. Set the timer up to 5 and 10 seconds if you short version video. You can also set to record both visual and audio from the screen using the microphone settings. In the end, you are left with other options of showing a floating thumbnail on your recording or keeping the last settings you have done here with the âRemember last selection optionâ. These are the options you can adjust before starting your screen record.</p><p>To stop recording all you have to do is press the small icon that appears in the top-right corner of your desktop screen. Visit your selected destination folder of the recording and bingo you can enjoy your screen recording.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-stop-recording.jpg"                      alt="macbook stop recording"                ></p><p>**<strong>Other Shortcut Keys:</strong></p><p>Other shortcut keys that can be used to take screenshots and screen recording letâs have a look at the following table.</p><table><thead><tr><th>**<strong>Shortcut Key</strong></th><th>**<strong>Function</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shift + Command + 3</td><td>Take a Full Screenshot.</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 4</td><td>Capturing a portion of the screen</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 4 + Spacebar</td><td>Take a screenshot of a certain window.</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 5</td><td>Bring you the screenshot and screen recording tools</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-2-Use-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#Part-2-Use-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Use QuickTime Player"></a>Part 2: Use QuickTime Player</h2><p>Another hidden application in your MacBook Air utility program that already comes built-in with Mac OS is QuickTime Player. With this player, you can easily record your screen and take screenshots along the system audio as well as microphone input. To access this application and utilize it for your purpose all you need is to follow the steps given in the coming section.</p><p>First, you will need to look into your applications row on your desktop screen. You will probably see the QuickTime player icon there. Right-click on the icon and start the new screen recorder to access the application. Or you can use the other method to access it with QuickTime open from the upper bar as shown in the figure below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-player-row-on-desktop-screen.jpg"                      alt="quicktime player row on desktop screen"                ></p><p>Once you are done with launching the GUI of the application, itâs time to learn how can you start recording now. Before starting your recording with the red icon of the start button as shown it is important to choose whether you want microphone input to be recorded or not. You can easily do it by enabling the internal microphone in the settings as shown in the figure. Once you are done with the settings itâs time to start your recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quciktime-internal-microphone.jpg"                      alt="quciktime internal microphone"                ></p><p>Click on the start recording button and you will see a new window will pop up to choose the screen recording mode from it as shown in the figure below. To record in the full-screen recording mode you just need to click randomly on the screen once and it will start recording the whole screen. Otherwise, drag and select a particular area on the screen and click start recording once shown and you will have the recording of the particular screen area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-drag-and-drop-on-screen.jpg"                      alt="quicktime drag and drop on screen"                ></p><p>Finally, if you are needed to stop recording, all you have to do is click on the QuickTime player icon in the application bar and select stop recording as shown.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-Price-to-Performance-Laptops-Under-500-Gaming-Edition"><a href="#Best-Price-to-Performance-Laptops-Under-500-Gaming-Edition" class="headerlink" title="Best Price-to-Performance Laptops Under $500 (Gaming Edition)"></a>Best Price-to-Performance Laptops Under $500 (Gaming Edition)</h2><p>Are you looking for the best gaming keyboard under 100$? Top keyboard makers are constantly pushing the boundaries of speed, design, material, and functionality. High pricing is inevitable as a result of this competitiveness. But donât be concerned! So you donât have to break the bank, weâve compiled a list of the best gaming keyboard under 100$. This article is ideal for individuals on a budget who are searching for high-quality mechanical boards.</p><p>We evaluated many choices, starting at $36, and tested the many types of keyboard that delivered excellent value for money â somewhat unexpectedly, the cheapest option was the one we wouldnât suggest. A new gaming keyboard may make a significant impact if you are starting to work from home or just playing more PC games than you did a few months ago.</p><p>Getting the proper gaming keyboard, like getting the proper gaming mouse, comes down to personal preference â from comfortability (wrist rest) about whether you would like RGB Lights, mechanical buttons, tactile feedback, configurable keys, separate media keys, or a slew of other features we canât begin to list. Also, check out our dictionary of keyboard terminology to help you narrow down your design choices.</p><h3 id="1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO"><a href="#1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO" class="headerlink" title="1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO"></a>1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro.jpg"                      alt="corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro"                ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons. It features rubber dome buttons, unlike most of the other keyboards on this list. Theyâre a little heavier to push than traditional mechanical keyboards, and they donât provide the same haptic feedback, and theyâre still light enough to satisfy gamers.</p><p>Itâs jam-packed with gaming features, including the ability to assign macros to any key and six additional macro keys just on the left side.

How to disable crossplay? How about cross-progression? Further, which platform is the best to play on? Whatâs the difference between Steam and Origin?</p><p>In this article, all of the questions above will be answered. No doubt, we have seen a massive increase in the popularity of Apex Legends. Millions of players are grouping in EAâs battle royal game, and it is quite clear why they like it so much. It is a free-to-play game with some quality graphics and gameplay. This gameâs core is based around looting and shooting, and it offers a few interesting twists in the battle royal format.</p><hr><h4 id="In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered"><a href="#In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered" class="headerlink" title="In this article, these questions will be answered"></a>In this article, these questions will be answered</h4><hr><p>Apex Legends Gameplay Basics:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-gameplay.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In this battle royal game, you are a part of a 3-person squad. There are 14 playable characters to choose from, and they are called legends in the game. If you compare all legends, you will find that they are equal in strength, speed, and firepower. Itâs their special abilities that make them different from each other. Every character has a unique ability that can help you in-game to leverage other players. So, you can choose a legend that suits your playstyle and is a perfect fit for your squad.</p><p>Teamwork is very critical in this game. When you jump into the battleground, there are two teammates on your side. Make sure to stick with them during the match if you want to win it. By working together, you can protect each other and outmatch the enemies by combining your abilities. You can stay connected with your teammates using the in-game communication system. You can mark different locations, highlight threats, pinpoint the location of gear pieces, and tell your teammates in which direction you are going.</p><p>There is a ring around the battleground that shrinks after fixed short intervals. As the rink shrinks, it forces the players into a smaller space on the map, and as a result, we observe more fights between different teams. If you want to win the game, then you have to be the last team standing. If your teammates are knocked down, then you can revive them and pick them up. If they are completely killed, you can pick up their banner in a fixed amount of time and have them jumped back into the game once again. This feature makes this game different from other battle royal games where if your teammate dies once, then he stays dead the rest of the game.</p><p>One thing that you must keep in mind while playing this game is that killing an opponent is a bit longer than other FPS (First Person Shooting) games. To kill an opponent, you may need to rely on several headshots, your legendsâ unique ability, and the support of your teammates.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Although this game is free of cost, it offers several in-game purchases. You can purchase Apex Coins, which is an in-game currency. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ingame-purchase.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You can use it to purchase loot boxes that contain skins and costumes. There are two locked characters in the game also, and you need to purchase them with Apex coins. So, you can get the maximum out of this game by spending some money and giving time to this game.</p><hr><h4 id="Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not"><a href="#Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?"></a><strong>Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?</strong></h4><p>Yes, Apex Legends is a cross-platform game. Initially, it wasnât a cross-platform game, but Apex became a cross-platform game after an update in autumn 2020. It means that two players playing on two different devices can group in a squad and play the game. Letâs explain it with an example. Suppose you have a pc and your friend has a PS4. Both of you can play together in a squad, even if you both have two different types of devices.</p><h4 id="How-to-turn-off-crossplay"><a href="#How-to-turn-off-crossplay" class="headerlink" title="How to turn off crossplay?"></a><strong>How to turn off crossplay?</strong></h4><p>Firstly, crossplay is enabled by default. Assume now youâre playing apex on PS4&#x2F;switch&#x2F;Xbox using a controller, you might be reluctant to crossplay against a PC player using keyboard and mouse. Because you might think that isnât fair. So why donât we turn it off and play only with game console players?</p><p>Step1, to disable it, you need to go to the setting button at the lobbyâs right bottom, as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting1.png"                      alt="ape-setting1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 2, under the gameplay tab, scroll down, and you can find cross-platform play.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting2.png"                      alt="apex-setting2"                ></p><h4 id="Does-it-have-cross-progression"><a href="#Does-it-have-cross-progression" class="headerlink" title="Does it have cross-progression?"></a><strong>Does it have cross-progression?</strong></h4><p>Unfortunately, because of technical and legal issues, no.

You can play it on different platforms like:</p><p><strong>Microsoft Xbox One S and X</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-one.jpg"                                     >You can play Apex Legends on Xbox One S, but you may need to compromise a little bit and play on a low resolution for better fps. Although the game will run just fine, you may need to make some adjustments to your graphics settings. You can play this game on 720p on Xbox One S, so make sure to sit a little closer to your screen to see everything.</p><p>If you want to get Apexâs best experience on Xbox consoles, you should play it on Xbox One X. If you switch from Xbox one S to Xbox one X, you will see a significant difference in the game performance. On the X version, you can run the game on 1080p. It offers overall better performance in terms of gameplay as compared to other Xbox variants.</p><p><strong>Xbox Series X and S</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-seriesx.jpg"                                     >Xbox series S and X are the latest generations of Xbox. They rival their competitor PS5 and offer competitive performance when you compare these consoles with a PS5. They do offer better gaming performance and better graphics. But, the question is, Can you play Apex on the latest generations of Xbox? The answer is yes. You will get better performance in terms of graphics and FPS but currently, the game isnât fully optimized for the latest generations. In the coming days it is expected that the game will be optimized for the latest consoles and you can enjoy the game to the fullest. Currently, you can enjoy 1440p gaming on these consoles and can get up to 120fps.</p><p><strong>Sony PlayStation 4</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ps4.png"                                     >You can also play Apex Legends on Sony PlayStation 4. Although you can play it on the standard PS4, if you want to get the best gaming experience, then you should play it on PS4 Pro. On PS4, you need to have a PlayStation Plus subscription if you want to play online multiplayer games, but in the case of Apex Legends, you do not need it.</p><p><strong>Sony PlayStation 5</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ps5-poster.png"                      alt="ps5-poster"                ></p><p>Sony PlayStation 5 is a next-generation console, and luckily Apex Legends is already playable on it. PS5 offers improved performance and better graphics as compared to its previous versions. If you were previously playing on PS4 and just switched to PS5, you can also retain all your progress and skins on PS5 also. You can use the same EA account and start enjoying Apex Legends on 1440p screen resolution.</p><p><strong>PC</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PC-apex.png"                                     >If you want to do competitive gaming in Apex Legends, then PC is the most suitable choice for you. It is because when you play using a mouse and keyboard instead of controllers, then your aim and movement are more precise. As it is an FPS category game, you can use a monitor with a high refresh rate to have smooth gameplay and reduce the lag. You must keep in mind that you need a PC with some good specs that can provide you with at least 60fps in the game. It would be best if you aim for a PC that can provide you maximum fps. 120 is the most recommended figure here.</p><p>PC Requirements For Apex Legends:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Components</strong></th><th><strong>Minimum</strong></th><th><strong>Recommended</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 7 (64-Bit)</td><td>Windows 7 (64-Bit)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel Core i3-6100 or AMD FX-4350</td><td>Intel Core i5-3570K or AMD equivalent</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>6GB</td><td>8GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 AMD Radeon HD 7730</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 AMD Radeon R9 290</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU RAM</strong></td><td>1GB</td><td>8GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hard Drive</strong></td><td>22GB of Free Space</td><td>22GB of Free Space</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Nintendo Switch</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-switch.png"                                     ></p><p>On March 9, 2021, EA released a version of this game for Nintendo switch. Currently, it is playable on the switch, and you can only match up with switch players, but soon it will be available to play with cross-platform support. It is a big achievement for EA to make this game playable on a small screen.</p><hr><h4 id="Apex-Legends-Steam-Vs-Origin-Whatâs-The-Difference"><a href="#Apex-Legends-Steam-Vs-Origin-Whatâs-The-Difference" class="headerlink" title="Apex Legends: Steam Vs Origin Whatâs The Difference?"></a><strong>Apex Legends: Steam Vs Origin Whatâs The Difference?</strong></h4><p>Apex Legends is playable on PC via both <strong>Steam and Origin</strong>. These are basically two different platforms and have their own game launchers. As the game is free to play so you can use either one of them.</p><p>If steam is already installed on your PC then just go to the game store and add Apex Legends to your library. Otherwise, you can also go to Origin game store and get Apex Legends from there. If you compare the performance of game on both platforms then you will find that there isnât much difference. On origin you may get slightly better performance and fps but the difference of fps is not that much. The game is free to play on both platforms so you can choose according to your comfort and preferences.</p><h4 id="How-to-Choose-Between-These-Platforms"><a href="#How-to-Choose-Between-These-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose Between These Platforms"></a><strong>How to Choose Between These Platforms</strong></h4><p>With Apex Legends available on so many platforms, sometimes it can be difficult to choose which platform is best for you. It all depends upon your preferences. If you already have a gaming console like X-box or PS4, you can play it on them. But if you want to play in a competitive environment and get the best gaming experience, then it is only possible on a PC. If you just want to chill with your friends and kill some time, then consoles can do the job for you. For maximum performance, a PC is recommended.</p><p>Bonusï¼Want to record and edit your wonderful Apex gameplay?

Despite the fact that you canât physically open your AirPods or go into the settings on the diminutive headphones, there are still plenty of troubleshooting steps you can take to fix audio issues.</p><p> So, before you spend a bunch of time chatting to Appleâs technical support, hereâs how to fix AirPods sound problems for yourself.</p><h2 id="1-Update-Your-iPhone-iPad-or-Mac"><a href="#1-Update-Your-iPhone-iPad-or-Mac" class="headerlink" title="1. Update Your iPhone, iPad, or Mac"></a>1. Update Your iPhone, iPad, or Mac</h2><p> The first step you should take is to update the operating system for whatever device your AirPods are paired to, be it an iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Android device, or Windows PC.</p><p> These updates are the best way to fix widespread bugs that have emerged, which might be causing the problems with your AirPods. Just use the relevant link below to learn how to update your device:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/" >Update an iPhone or iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-apple-watch/" >Update an Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-mac-software/" >Update a Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-your-android-phone/" >Update an Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-windows-software-guide/" >Update a Windows PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="2-Update-Your-AirPods-Firmware"><a href="#2-Update-Your-AirPods-Firmware" class="headerlink" title="2. Update Your AirPods Firmware"></a>2. Update Your AirPods Firmware</h2><p> After updating your paired device, you should also update the firmware on your AirPods. This is a little trickier to do because thereâs no âUpdate Firmwareâ button. Instead, follow our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-airpods/" >update the firmware on your AirPods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Check the Accessibility Audio Balance</h2><p> If you need to fix your AirPods because the sound is louder on one side, it might actually be the result of a feature, rather than a bug.

Itâs a good way to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/apple-airpods-problems-fix/" >fix all manner of AirPods problems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> So, return your AirPods to the case and connect it to a charging cable until itâs fully charged.

But before you do that, try turning the audio all the way down. Make sure youâre playing some audio through your AirPods while you adjust the volume to make sure you arenât changing the ringer volume instead.</p><p> After turning your AirPods all the way down, unpair them from your device and forget the Bluetooth connection.

This could be caused by a weak signal or interference from other devices and appliances. To troubleshoot your Bluetooth connection, make sure your AirPods are close to the device theyâre paired with. Stay in the same room, and try not to let any big object get in between the two.</p><p> If your audio is still glitchy, try moving away from any objects that might interfere with your Bluetooth connection. These could include:</p><ul><li>Poorly shielded cables</li><li>Microwaves</li><li>Wi-Fi routers</li></ul><p> Lastly, try using the AirPods with a different device to see if the Bluetooth problems were with your original device, rather than the AirPods. Needless to say, if your AirPods audio is glitchy no matter which device you use them with, then you know that youâre dealing with an AirPods problem.</p><p> If you do discover that one particular device is causing problems with your AirPods, try disconnecting any other Bluetooth devices from it (including an Apple Watch), then try toggling Bluetooth on and off or resetting the device entirely to fix it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-Troubleshoot-Your-Wi-Fi-Connection"><a href="#9-Troubleshoot-Your-Wi-Fi-Connection" class="headerlink" title="9.

The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus â+â sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the outer by adding an âLâ shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle5.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle6.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle6"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft"><a href="#How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft" class="headerlink" title="How to make a Sphere in Minecraft"></a>How to make a Sphere in Minecraft</h2><p>The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now itâs time to create layers of the sphere. To do that you have to create a layer of 7 blocks wide on the top and the bottom of the column.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Since you have created the 1st and the 16th levels of the sphere, now you have to follow this procedure for all remaining layers: Make a layer of 11 blocks for the 2nd and 15th levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Follow the same pattern throughout the levels: 13 blocks layer on 3rd and 14th level, 15 blocks on 4th and 13th levels, 17 blocks on 5th and 12th level, and so on. As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks. Follow this process until you reach the middle of the column.</p><p>These circles and spheres are useful in Minecraft and they play a very vital role in building your own world in Minecraft. They can be very beneficial while creating buildings, houses, and more places. These can be used as curves to give your buildings an aesthetic look and feel. But this whole process needs practice and efforts to master it and use it for your own purposes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere4"                ></p><hr><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Creating such amazing things and sharing them on your social media and video sharing platforms can get you a lot of audience and views.

Unless Twitch streamers enable Video on Demand, the live stream will not be accessible to the viewers later. However, it is quite possible that you cannot watch a live stream completely because you are occupied with other important works, and that is when you can record Twitch stream so that you can watch it later whenever you have time.</p><p>Even Twitch streamers may want to record their own live streams so that they can upload them on other video streaming and social media platforms. Apart from enabling VOD on Twitch by the streamers, you can record Twitch with a professional screen recorder. In this article, we have illustrated how to record Twitch streams on Windows PC and Mac easily.</p><p>Way 1. <a href="#part1">Save Video with VOD on Twitch</a></p><p>Way 2. <a href="#part2">How to Record Twitch Stream on Windows</a></p><p>Way 3. <a href="#part3">Record Twitch with OBS Studio</a></p><p>Way 4. <a href="#part4">Record Twitch Stream with XSplit</a></p><p>Way 4. <a href="#part4">Record Twitch Lice Stream on Mac</a></p><h2 id="Way-1-Save-Video-with-VOD-on-Twitch"><a href="#Way-1-Save-Video-with-VOD-on-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Way 1.

If a Twitch streamer enables VOD, his live stream will be saved for the streamer to watch it and upload it on his channel for his viewers to watch any time after the live stream gets over. Streamers can make highlights of the long live stream instantly and upload on social media and video streaming sties like YouTube. Here are the steps to save Twitch live streams by enabling VOD.</p><p>Step 1: Log into your Twitch account and go to Creator Dashboard.

This article is meant for you if thatâs the case!</p><p>The days of buying dedicated handheld consoles to fulfill entertainment needs on the go are long gone. The Gameboy, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita, and Sonyâs PSP were the most commonly used gaming consoles a decade ago. As times change, we increasingly rely on our smartphones for a variety of activities. Smartphones are now so powerful that they can replace laptops and desktop computers because of their chipsets. Gaming on the go is by far the most intriguing development of smartphones.</p><p>Nintendo 3DS is certainly at the top of the list of most popular handheld gaming consoles, perhaps alongside the PSP and Gameboy. It is undeniable that the Nintendo 3DS has some of the greatest classic games of all time, and one can totally understand why people might be tempted to pick one up - even in 2024. Since our smartphones are easily accessible, buying a new device just to play games that are already available would be a waste of resources. Using emulators, you are able to play games developed for other hardware on your phone.</p><p>If you search on google for the best 3DS emulators for Android, you will have limitless options, and you can easily get confused among so many choices, such as RetroArch, DraStic DS Emulator, NDS4droid, etc. We are lending you a helping hand as we have prepared a list of top 10 3ds emulators that you can use on your android smartphones and have the classic gaming experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isnât good enough?

Open-source and ad-free, this emulator is ideal for gamers who love being immersed in their game.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Audio-Capture-Essentials-Mastering-Mac-Setup"><a href="#Audio-Capture-Essentials-Mastering-Mac-Setup" class="headerlink" title="Audio Capture Essentials: Mastering Mac Setup"></a>Audio Capture Essentials: Mastering Mac Setup</h2><p>Sound Studio is one of the industry-leading audio recording software that has millions of downloads over different app stores and platforms. The application is specifically designed to match the high performance of MacBooks with the macOS support. The interface inside the application is handy with a bunch of tools for utilizing every aspect of sound recording. With Sound Studio you will feel almost like sitting in a record room with professional hardware.</p><p>The app even lets you digitalize any of the records from tapes as well as vinyl records and also lets you record any live performances that are going on with high-quality audio output. The equalizer in the application has dozens of features that will allow you to mix any of your recordings with background tracks, voice-overs, and many more digital effects. Hereâs more about it:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-features-of-Sound-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-Key-features-of-Sound-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Key features of Sound Studio"></a>Part 1. Key features of Sound Studio</h2><p>If you are looking for powerful recording software that can give you industry-leading features, then Sound Studio is the best choice for you. It is specifically designed to provide an ultimate user experience with fewer complications and the highest quality output. And with the new updated version from Sound Studio, you will have even more functions on your lap. The following are some of the best features of the Sound Studio application:</p><p><strong>1. High-quality music output</strong></p><p>One of the basic requirements for any audio recorder is that the output quality for the recorded files must be crystal clear and shouldnât be of low quality. And Sound Studio meets all these aspects in voice recording by providing its users HD quality output sounds with simple and easy steps.</p><p><strong>2. Multiple formats support</strong></p><p>The application is also enabled with multiple audio format supports which means that there are several formats in which you can create your record as well as export it. You can work with voice recordings from MP3 or M4A files and then you can save them in different formats such as AIDD and WAV.</p><p><strong>3. Fast and convenient editing</strong></p><p>The user interface along with the software integration of macOS gives Sound Studio a very fast yet convenient editing studio feature. In this section, you will be able to create your audio in several layers and save it with different digital effects such as reverb, delays, chorus, or even flange filters.</p><p><strong>4. Digital conversion</strong></p><p>The application also allows the users to visit their memory lane by helping them digitize the tapes as well as vinyl records from their PC itself. In this way, everyone can save their old dusty records into digital formats which will enable them to modify the voice configurations and then edit them with different layers of effects.</p><p><strong>5. Batch processing using AppleScript or Automator</strong></p><p>For people who want to process their audio in a batch or want to combine different audio recordings at the same time, they can use the AppleScript or any Automator for the same since Sound Studio supports the integration of both thus enabling a more powerful part of audio processing.</p><p><strong>6. Live performance recording</strong></p><p>There are situations where we want to record the ongoing live performances from our systems and in such scenarios, Sound Studio can help you efficiently. With built-in live recording mode, you can record the live performances from voice actors almost instantly with the push of a few buttons on your system.</p><p><strong>7. Digital noise cancellation</strong></p><p>The application also cancels out the extra and unnecessary voices from the background after you record any voice in the Sound Studio. Thus, when you play it with enabling the digital noise cancellation feature, you will be able to listen to clear sound without any disruption from the outside world.</p><p><strong>8. Regular updates</strong></p><p>Updates are the most important things for any software since the developers provide a clean experience with each new update and try to remove the bugs and issues reported by users. Also, Sound Studio developers provide regular updates to all their users with just a one-time subscription.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-Audio-with-Sound-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-Audio-with-Sound-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Record Audio with Sound Studio?"></a>Part 2. How to Record Audio with Sound Studio?</h2><p>Sound Studio Mac is believed to be one of the most efficient and easy-to-use applications for audio recording. But since it has so many menus and options available in its studio audio interface, the features can seem to be overwhelming sometimes.</p><p>You can record audio and use Sound Studio by following these easy steps to avoid any complications:</p><p>First, visit the official website of Sound recording Studio and then download it to your macOS. After you are done with the downloading process, install it with the installation wizard and then open the application.</p><p>When you open the application for the first time, you will see a bunch of menus on the top such as File, edit, audio, and many more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/a-brunch-of-menus.jpg"                      alt="a brunch of menus"                ></p><p>Then, on your screen, you will see the Mic button which is the option to start the recording.

A layer can be described as any type of image, moving or still, that is superimposed over a background image. However, just adding one layer over another will not create a strong visual impact on the spectator, which is why using Blending Modes is recommended if you want to <strong>blend two overlaying videos or images</strong> seamlessly.</p><p>It is a widely accepted opinion that Blend Modes can only be used in Adobe Premiere Pro or After Effects, but in this article, we are going to bust that myth and show you how to utilize Blending Modes in Filmora Scrn. Before we get started, letâs figure out what blending modes is.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-office-pdf-editor-1x.890dbda.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)âYearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1853659/21526" target="_top" id="1853659"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-1853659"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="750"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1853659/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-Blending-Modes-in-Filmora"><a href="#What-are-Blending-Modes-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="What are Blending Modes in Filmora?"></a>What are Blending Modes in Filmora?</h2><p>Combining videos or images into a single frame is an art that is much older than digital pictures, so when trying to understand Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn it is best to try to visualize two pieces of celluloid film, one over another. Two pieces of film are transparent, but the images they contain do not mix with each other, that is why when you are using Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn you are actually merging videos and allowing their pixels to mix.</p><p>Different ways of combining pixels are called modes, and for that reason, the properties of the <strong>Linear Burn mode</strong> are not the same as the properties of the <strong>Multiply blending mode</strong>. Each mode you select, brings preset image transparency as well as brightness, contrast and color values. Which mode you will use depends mostly on the context and the images you want to use in your video.</p><p>The <strong>Normal mode</strong> is a part of the standard set of blending modes in almost all photo and video editing programs. It enables you to keep the top layer intact, by preventing the pixels from two images to merge. It is a perfect PIP blending mode since it allows you to keep two overlaying images separate and have two different narratives within the same shot. Producers of YouTube videos and tutorials of any kind or gamers who want to entertain their audiences should use the Normal mode when editing their footage captured with Filmora Scrn.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-normal-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>The <strong>Screen Mode</strong> is best used when you are working with dark monochrome backgrounds because it reduces the dark areas in the video thus enabling you to blend the top layer into the background seamlessly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png"                      border="0"                >WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-screen-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>Utilizing this mode successfully requires previous preparation because the effects youâll get if you use the Screen mode with a footage that is not best suited for this mode are far from impressive. Therefore, the video clips you want to overlay and blend with each other must be recorded perfectly in order to get the best results.</p><p>The <strong>Multiply Mode</strong> is also one of the frequently used blending modes that <strong>multiplies the numbers for each pixel of the overlaying video clip</strong> with a matching pixel from the background video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2337838&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzZwphIv4RM" title="APFill - Ink and Toner Coverage Calculator" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-multiply-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>This mode will enable you to create the black background for your video effortlessly, and highlight the subjects in the video clip you intend to use as a top layer. You need to choose carefully which video clips you are going to use and how are they going to look on a dark background if you want to produce visually pleasing videos that captivate the viewerâs attention.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Blending-Modes"><a href="#How-to-use-Blending-Modes" class="headerlink" title="How to use Blending Modes?"></a>How to use Blending Modes?</h2><p>Applying different blending modes and switching between them is easy, and it wonât take more than a few minutes of your time, once you get a hold of it. Filmora Scrn features a number of different blending modes, so figuring out what each mode can do may take some time and practice. Letâs have a look at how you can add multiple layers to your videos and how to use blending modes.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Importing-files-into-Filmora-Scrn"><a href="#Step-1-Importing-files-into-Filmora-Scrn" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Importing files into Filmora Scrn"></a>Step 1 - Importing files into Filmora Scrn</h4><p>In case youâve used Filmora Scrnâs screen recorder to capture your video, the video clip will be opened in the softwareâs video editor and placed in the media bin, immediately after the recording session is over. However, the Wondershareâs software also allows you to import the footage youâve captured with a video camera or any other video recording software or device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-add-files.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Import Media "                ></p><p>Click on the Add Files icon in the Media bin, and select the footage you want to use in your project.
